# yt_MDA_Cluster

This repository documents the process of building a YouTube corpus and identifying informal videos using multi-dimensional analysis and cluster analysis. 
The project is still ongoing, so this repository will continue to be updated.

The process was piloted in the following paper (currently under review)

Cooper, C. R. (2023) The identification of YouTube videos that feature the linguistic features of English informal speech to aid the acquisition of everyday conversation for EFL learners [Manuscript submitted for publication]. Center for Foreign Language Education and Research. Rikkyo University.
