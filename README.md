# yt_MDA_Cluster

This repository documents the process of building a YouTube corpus and identifying informal videos using multi-dimensional analysis and cluster analysis. 
The project is still ongoing, so this repository will continue to be updated.

The process was piloted in the following paper:

Cooper, C. R. (2023). The identification of YouTube videos that feature the linguistic features of English informal speech. Applied Corpus Linguistics, 3(3), 100068. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acorp.2023.100068
