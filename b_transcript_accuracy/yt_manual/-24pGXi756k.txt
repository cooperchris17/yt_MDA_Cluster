A CRASH THAN A SHOOTING,
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SCENE WHEN
A GOOD SAMARITAN TRIED TO HELP?
THE JANUARY SIXTH COMMITTEE
DROPS ITS SUBPOENA AGAINST
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP,
BUT ANOTHER INVESTIGATION IS
WRAPPING UP.
WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE
EXPECT TO GET TOMORROW.
STARTING AT 4:00, A
CONTROVERSIAL LAW ABOUT CRIME
FROM AN ILLINOIS JUDGE.
SERENA FONZO BREAKS IT ALL
DOWN.
THIS STATUTE IS LONG,
CONVERGING AND CONTROVERSIAL.
THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES,
DETAIN A BOWL AND NON-DETAINED
BOWL.
THE ARRESTS HAPPEN.
BECAUSE JANUARY 1st, SOME
COUNTIES FOLLOW THE OLD SET OF
RULES.
OTHERS WILL FOLLOW THE SAFETY
ACT RULES.
Reporter: LET'S START WITH A
CRIME, SAY, ROBBERY, STOLEN
MAIL.
PRE-SAFETY ACT, ARREST, CHARGE,
SEE A JUDGE, JUDGE SETS BAIL OR
NO BAIL.
POST SAFETY ACT, THE PROCESS
CHANGES.
THE STATES ATTORNEY IS THE
ONE THAT HAS TO FILE THE
PETITION BEFORE THE JUDGE.
THE JUDGE HAS NO SAY.
Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THE LAW
DEEMS SOME CRIMES NOT
ATTAINABLE LIKE STEALING
PACKAGES OR A, B, C
MISDEMEANORS.
THE PERSON WHO GETS CAUGHT GETS
A SUMMONS TO APPEAR BEFORE A
JUDGE LATER.
IF A PETITION IS NOT ALLOWED
TO BE FILED, THE JUDGE WILL
HAVE TO RELEASE THEM.
Reporter: IT HAS TO MEET A
LIST OF STANDARDS.
EXECUTORS HAVE TO PROVE THE
DEFENDANT POSES A RISK TO A
SPECIFIC PERSON OR PERSONS
AND/OR HAS A HIGH RISK OF
FLEEING BEFORE TRIAL.
THEY HAVE TO PETITION TO KEEP
THE PERSON IN JAIL, WHICH MANY
SAY TAKES THE HANDS OUT OF THE
JUDGE AND PUTS PRESSURE ON THE
VICTIMS.
CERTAIN OFFENSES.
MURDER --
Reporter: NOW INTRO THIS
LATEST LAWSUIT.
THE KANKAKEE COUNTY JUDGE RULED
IT KEEPS THINGS LIKE HAVING LAW
ENFORCEMENT WEARING BODY WORN
CAMERAS, ALSO MENTIONED IN THE
IN ITS TRACKS SO LONG AS YOU
LIVE IN ONE OF THE 54 COUNTIES
MENTIONED IN THAT SUIT. IF THE
PACKAGE THIEF IS ARRESTED IN
KANKAKEE, THEY FOLLOW THE OLD
SET OF RULES IN OTHER COUNTIES.
THE SAFETY ACT APPLIES.
EXPERTS SAY THEY ARE EXPECTING
PROSECUTORS TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE
THAT A TRIAL BEFORE THE ACTUAL
TRIAL.
WITNESSES HAVE TO DO THE
INTERVIEW. POLICE REPORTS HAVE
TO BE WRITTEN.
SO THE DAY AFTER SOMEBODY GETS
ARRESTED, THERE IS A LOT OF DATA
THAT HASN'T BEEN COLLECTED.
Reporter: ALL OF THIS COULD
CHANGE IF THE SAME JUDGE ISSUES
AN INJUNCTION BEFORE JANUARY
1st.
THAT WOULD MEAN THE RULING
WOULD APPLY STATEWIDE.
THE SAFETY ACT WOULD NOT GO
INTO EFFECT IN THE NEW YEAR AND
