- Why social media marketing
doesn't work for most people?
It doesn't matter if it is Facebook,
or Instagram, or
LinkedIn, or even Twitter.
Social media marketing just doesn't work,
or at least for most people.
And no, it's not because you
don't have enough followers,
instead, it doesn't work
because you only focus on
getting more followers.
See, that's the issue.
Let's say you want a million followers.
If you want lots of followers,
you have to create content
that appeals to the masses.
For example, I'm in digital marketing,
that's a vertical I'm in.
I own a digital marketing
agency called NP Digital.
And I can start to create
more generic content,
and my follower account will rise faster,
which is funny because that's
what my social media team
keeps telling me to do.
But I don't.
Why?
Because yes, it'll get
us more followers faster,
but every time we do that,
you can guess how many more
clients we get or even leads?
It gets us a whopping zero
extra leads clients and revenue.
And I've tested this out
hundreds of times, literally.
So my most popular content
pieces I've created
have been around lifestyle marketing,
such as spending money on fancy clothes
or what I learned from flying first class
on over a hundred trips.
And I'm not saying you
should fly first class.
There's nothing wrong with economy.
It creates buzz,
but it doesn't convince our
ideal customers to work with us.
On the flip side,
if I give SEO tips or marketing
tips, you know what happens?
I get way less views.
I get way less likes on my content.
But people who watch my
content are interested in SEO,
and portion of those people
eventually convert into leads
and some even in customers.
In other words,
yes, you need followers to
make social media marketing
work for you,
and of course, you need great content,
but the big mistake that people make,
it's that they create content
that focuses on the masses
so they can boost this vanity
metric AKA follower account,
instead of focusing on creating content
that targets their ideal customer.
So with your social media marketing,
focus on your ideal customer
and not on everyone.
That's how you make it work.
