THIS YEAR WITH MURRAY OUT AND 
PORTER JR. TRYING TO GET BACK.
AND SOMEHOW HE IS STILL IN THE 
CONVERSATION FOR MVP.
>> HE IS NOT JUST IN THE 
CONVERSATION.
NIKOLA JOKIC CLAIMED 62 OF THE 
FIRST PLACE VOTES IN THE STRAW 
POLL JUMPING WAY AHEAD OF JOEL 
EMBIID WITH 29 FIRST PLACE 
VOTES.
AND THEN JANUARY GIANNIS 
ANTETOKOUNMPO WITH NINE.
AND IN THIS, THEY SIMULATE THE 
MVP VOTING.Y GIANNIS 
ANTETOKOUNMPO WITH NINE.
AND IN THIS, THEY SIMULATE THE 
MVP VOTING.
>> AND SO IN ADDITION TO THAT 
STRAW POLL, CAESARS SPORTS BOOK 
ADJUST ADJUSTED THE MVP ODDS TO 
MAKE JOKIC AND EMBIID 
CO-FAVORITES.
IT HAD BEEN EMBIID.
GIVEN ALL OF THIS, AND I WOULD 
BE REMISS NOT TO SAY THAT 
ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE AFTER THE 
STRAW POLL CAME OUT.
SO I WANT TO DO A LITTLE STRAW 
POLL "NBA TODAY" STYLE AND MAKE 
THE CASE TO THE OTHER GUYS.
WE TALK ABOUT JOKIC AND EMBIID.
SO IF THEY FINISH STRONG, PERK, 
I WANT TO START WITH YOU AND AN 
UPSET, YOU WANTED TO MAKE THE 
CASE FOR GIANNIS.
GO AHEAD.
>> I DO.
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE 
GETTING BORED WITH GIANNIS AND 
HIS DOMINANCE, RIGHT?
THIS IS A GUY THAT IS AVERAGING 
29-11-6, ALMOST 7 ASSISTS.
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT GIANNIS, YES
HE HAS HOLLIDAY AND MIDDLETON, 
HE CAN STILL GET THE NUMBERS 
WHEN HE HAS THOSE PLAYERS 
ALONGSIDE OF HIM.
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE TAKING 
HIM FOR GRANTED LIKE WE DID 
LeBRON JAMES WHEN HE WAS MAKING 
THOSE RUNS IN THE EASTERN 
CONFERENCE.
AND HE COULD HAVE WON MULTIPLE 
MVPs.
IT IS THE SAME CASE FOR GIANNIS.
BUCKS ARE STILL ONE OF THE BEST 
TEAMS IN THE EASTERN CONFERENCE 
AND THEY HAVE BEEN FLYING UNDER 
THE RADAR AND GIANNIS HAS GOTTEN
BETTER.
>> SO I SAID THIS WAS AN UPSET 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T 
CHOOSE JA MORANT.
WHAT IS JA'S CASE TO WIN MVP?
>> TALKING ABOUT PLAYERS THAT 
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER, I FEEL LIKE 
JA IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
WE SAID THAT HE IS TOO GOOD TO 
GRADUATE FROM MOST IMPROVED.
BUT LOOK AT THE GRIZZLIES, 53-23
ON THE SEASON, SECOND BEST 
RECORD IN THE NBA.
SOMETIMES YOU GET A SHOOTING 
STAR.
AND WE DID NOT SEE THAT 
HAPPENING OR WE DID NOT EXPECT 
THAT AS MUCH.
THAT IS WHAT JA HAS DONE.
HE HAS HAD A DOMINANT SEASON AND
I FEEL LIKE THAT HE COULD STEAL 
SOME MVP VOTES EASILY.
>> LISTEN UP SUNS FANS BECAUSE 
J.J. IS ABOUT TO MAKE THE CASE 
FOR MR. DEVIN BOOKER.
>> THE EASY ANSWER IS THAT HE IS
THE LEADING SCORER ON THE BEST 
TEAM.
BUT IT IS REALLY, REALLY MUCH 
DEEPER THAN THAT.
HE IS THE 10th PLAYER TO AVERAGE
AT LEAST 25-5-5 ON A TEAM WITH A
WINNING PERCENTAGE OF 800 OR 
BETTER.
EIGHT OF THOSE PREVIOUS NINE 
PLAYERS HAVE WON MVP.
WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT HIS 
CLUTCH TIME PERFORMANCE.
SUNS ARE 24-5 IN CLUTCH GAMES 
THAT HE PLAYS.
HE IS SHOOTING 57% FROM THE 
FIELD AND 41% FROM THREE IN 
CLUTCH TIME.
AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT THE SUNS 
WOULD FALL OFF WHEN CP GOT HURT.
HE WENT FOR 28-5-7 AND LED THE 
SUNS TO AN 8-3 RECORD.
PERK MAKES FUN OF ME ALL THE 
TIME BECAUSE I'M AN ANALYTICS 
GUY.
BUT I'M ALSO AN EYE TEST GUY AND
MY EYES ARE TELLING ME HE IS A 
DESERVING MVP.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF GIVING MUT 
PLAYERS FLOWERS.
SO WHO ELSE HAVE YOU GOT?
>> JAYSON TATUM.
>> THANK YOU.
>> AND JAYSON TATUM HAS BEEN 
BALLING.
ALSO CELTICS HAVE BEEN SURGING.
IT IS NOT EASY TO REVIVE A 
FRANCHISE THAT HAD GREATER 
EXPECTATIONS MID SEASON WITH A 
FIRST YEAR COACH.
AND HE HAS EMERGED AS THAT 
LEADER.
SO I LOVE TO SEE HIS DEVELOPMENT
AND WE SEE THESE NUMBERS, BUT 
NOW YOU ARE SEEING HIM 
CAREER-HIGHS AND POINTS IN 
REBOUNDS AND ASSISTS.
HE DESERVES TO BE IN THE 
CONVERSATION AS WELL.
>> SO WE'VE HIT ON TATUM AND 
MORANT AND BOOKER.
OBVIOUSLY GIANNIS, JOKIC, 
EMBIID.
BUT WHAT ABOUT LUKA?
HE IS THE ONLY PLAYER IN THE 
LEAGUE TO AVERAGE 25-8-8.
ANDHE CARIES THIS TEAM.
HE IS SECOND IN THE NBA IN USAGE
RATE, THAT IS BEHIND ONLY JOEL 
EMBIID.
AND HE IMPACTS WINNING.
WHEN HE IS ON THE COURT, MAVS 
WIN 66% OF THEIR GAMES.
IF YOU TAKE HIM OFF OF THE 
FLOOR, IT IS JUST NOT THE SAME 
TEAM.
SO BECAUSE HE IS ABLE TO PUT 
THIS TEAM ON HIS BACK, I KNOW 
THE MAVERICKS STILL HAVE 
SOMETHING TO PROVE IN THE 
POSTSEASON, THIS IS A REGULAR 
SEASON AWARD AND DONCIC IS 
DESERVING TO BE IN THE 
CONVERSATION.
>> I AGREE.
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE OPRAH OIG 
TODAY.
YOU GET AN MVP, YOU GET AN MVP.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW IT HAPPENS DOWN THE STRETCH.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW IT HAPPENS DOWN THE STRETCH.
>> WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MVP 
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW AND WE 
LOOK AT ALL THE MVP CANDIDATES 
AND THE GUYS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE 
CONSIDER TO BE IN THE 
CONVERSATION, GUESS WHAT, THEY 
ARE INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS.
AND I REMEMBER THIS SUMMER I 
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT 
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS ARE TAKING
OVER THE GAME OF BASKETBALL.
AND ONE OF THE FORMER FLARES 
DRAYMOND GREEN HAD SOMETHING TO 
SAY TO ME.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GUYS 
THAT WON THE MVPS HAVE BEEN 
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS.
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND 
WE THINK ABOUT JOKIC OR EMBIID 
OR GIANNIS, LUKA, THOSE ARE FOUR
OF THE TOP SEVEN GUYS IN THE NBA
THAT ARE INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS 
THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN MAKE A CASE
FOR WINNING THE MVP.
SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE
THIS AND I SAY THINGS LI
