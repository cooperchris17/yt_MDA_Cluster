CAN THE NEW GOP HOUSE PLATOON
KILL BIDEN’S BIG GOVERNMENT
SOCIALISM?
LET’S ASK NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER
HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR.
AUTHOR OF "DEFEATING BIG
GOVERNMENT SOCIALISM."
SAVING AMERICA’S FUTURE. NEWT, YOU WROTE A GREAT PIECE ON
NEWT, YOU WROTE A GREAT PIECE ON
THE WEBSITE ABOUT THIS
THAT HAVE BEEN SORT OF THE
CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY’S
PROGRAM EVER SINCE.
AND I THINK FRANKLY, WE GOT A
LITTLE TOO MUCH INTO BEING
ANTI-BIDEN AND NOT ENOUGH INTO
BEING PRO-PROSPERITY AND I THINK
THAT SLOWED DOWN THE MOMENTUM
BUT, I ALSO TELL YOU, LARRY, WE
GOT FOUR OR FIVE MILLION MORE
VOTES THAN THE DEMOCRATS AND I
THINK A LOT OF THE ANALYSIS IS
SORT OF SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
WITHOUT LOOKING YET IN DETAIL.
WE DID FAR BETTER WITH WOMEN
THAN WE DID IN 2018.
WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE OUR
STRENGTH AMONG HISPANICS WHICH
HAS BEEN GOING UP EVERY SINGLE
ELECTION.
WE BEGAN TO INCREASE OUR
STRENGTH AMONG
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
WE HAD A BIG JUMP IN OUR SUPPORT
AMONG ASIAN-AMERICANS, SO THERE
WAS A LOT THERE TO LOOK AT, YOU
KNOW, I GOT INTRIGUED BECAUSE
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOUSE AS A
MINORITY MEMBER, THE DEMOCRAT
MAJORITIES WERE SO BIG IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO ME TO CHECK TO SEE
ABOUT VERY NARROW MARGINS BUT
WHEN KEVIN McCARTHY BECOMES
SPEAKER, I THINK IT WILL BE
ANNOUNCED TODAY OR TOMORROW, HE
CROSSED THE 218 VOTE THRESHOLD,
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN CONGRESSES
SINCE 1917 WITH A MARGIN 220,
221, 222.
ITS MUCH MORE COMMON THAN IN THE
PAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
HE HAS GOT TO START I THINK ON
THE ONE FRONT WITH SERIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS, BECAUSE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
KNOW THINGS.
ON THE OTHER FRONT HE HAS GOT TO
START, HE ALREADY PROMISED, THAT
THEIR FIRST VOTE WOULD BE TO
ELIMINATE THE 87,000 INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE AGENTS.
I THINK THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD
INITIAL TEST WHERE WE’RE GOING.
REMEMBER HOUSE REPUBLICANS
GAINED SEATS IN 20 WHILE LOSING
THE PRESIDENCY.
THEY GAINED SEATS THIS YEAR.
THEY’RE IN POSITION TO I THINK
GROW THAT MAJORITY.
TO SET THE STAGE FOR ’24.
I WILL SAY QUICKLY, THIS IS LIKE
A SITUATION IN CHESS WHERE WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO IS SET UP A
SERIES OF FORKS WHICHEVER THING
YOUR OPPONENT DOES THEY LOSE
SOMETHING.
SO THEY BRING UP THE RIGHT
LEGISLATION, IF THEY CAN GET IT
THROUGH THE SENATE WHICH WILL BE
HARDER, THEN BIDEN CAN EITHER
VETO IT OR WE’LL BEAT HIM IN ’24
OR HE CAN SIGN IT.
THAT WILL PROVE REPUBLICANS ARE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
IF THEY DO A SERIES OF THINGS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THEY
COULD HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD TWO
YEARS.
LARRY: I WOULD THINK, JUST ON
THAT POINT, I WOULD THINK, I
DON’T KNOW, YOU MAY NOT HAVE
HEARD THE ART LAFFER INTERVIEW A
FEW MOMENTS AGO. ARTHUR WANTS THE GOP TO REALLY
ARTHUR WANTS THE GOP TO REALLY
EMPHASIZE THEIR STEWARDSHIP OF
THE GROWTH ECONOMY, STEWARDSHIP
OF THE ISSUE, NOT ONLY ISSUE BUT
A KEY ISSUE.
IN TERMS OF BIG GOVERNMENT
SOCIALISM, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE,
STOP THE MASSIVE SPENDING THAT
LED TO HIGH INFLATION AND THE
MONEY PRINTING.
STOP OVERREGULATING THE ECONOMY.
THOSE ARE KEY POINTS.
GOING TO BE A NASTY ECONOMY,
NEWT.
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, IN A MONTH’S
TIME WHEN THE GOP TAKES POWER,
WHATEVER IT WILL BE SIX OR EIGHT
WEEKS TIME, YOU WILL STILL HAVE
THE THREAT OF RECESSION AND HIGH
INFLATION.
SO THE GOP HAS GOT TO ACT.
>> LOOK IT, AS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
A CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL
RESERVE WHO HAS SAID PUBLICLY HE
WANTS TO GET AT LEAST 6%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
HE DIDN’T OFFER TO GIVE UP HIS
OWN JOB AS PART OF THAT
UNEMPLOYMENT TALKING ABOUT
DOUBLING THE RATE OF
UNEMPLOYMENT AS A SOLUTION YOU
KNOW THE PAIN LEVEL WILL BE
SUBSTANTIAL.
IF THEY TRY TO WRING THE
LIQUIDITY OUT OF SYSTEM AS YOU
KNOW, BOTH IN HOUSING AND IN
COMMODITIES, THEY’RE GOING TO
HAVE SOME PEOPLE HAVE ESTIMATED
A 25 TO 35% DROP IN VALUE.
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY ANGRY.
THE PARTY WHICH EMPHASIZES JOBS
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, RIGHT BACK
TO RONALD REAGAN, BACK TO ART
LAFFER, BACK TO YOU, JACK KEMP,
ALL OF US HAD THIS FIGHT IN THE
LATE ’70s.
WE SAID YOU KNOW THERE IS BETTER
SOLUTION.
IF YOU INCREASE THE SUPPLY YOU
MOP UP THE INFLATION BECAUSE YOU
HAVE MORE GASOLINE, THE PRICE
GOES DOWN.
IF YOU GET MORE WHEAT AND CORN,
THE PRICE GOES DOWN, THAT IS
TRUE ACROSS THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
I THINK REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO BE
THE PARTY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
THEY SHOULD ALSO BE THE PARTY
THAT DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS
MANUFACTURING BOTH FOR THE JOBS
AND ALSO FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM
CHINA.
I THINK IT WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY
HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT KIND OF
APPROACH.
LARRY: SO I JUST THINK, NEWT,
THERE IS A LOT OF FINGERPOINTING
AND RECRIMINATIONS THAT ALWAYS
HAPPENS WHEN THINGS DON’T GO SO
WELL, BUT BASICALLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THE GOP
HAS, IS GOING TO TAKE THE HOUSE
BACK AND THAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT.
TO ME, THAT IS LIKE THE NUMBER
ONE ISSUE, OKAY, WE HAVE A
CERTAIN DISAPPOINTMENT.
WE DIDN’T GET BOTH HOUSES WHO,
BLAH, BLAH.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
THERE IS A MILLION REASONS WHY.
THERE IS A MILLION REASONS WHY
NOT, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, LOOK
WHERE THEY ARE.
THEY CAN TAKE THE HOUSE AND USE
THAT AS THEIR OPPORTUNITY.
IT KOBE THE COULD BE THE
OPPORTUNITIES OF A LIFETIME
REALLY.
>> I WROTE A NEWSLETTER AT
GINGRICH 360 WHERE I SAID THE
SINGLE BIGGEST MOMENT IS
TRANSFERRING THE SPEAKER SHIP
BECAUSE, AS MATT LECAR WHO WORKS
FOR KEVIN SAID, THEY DON’T MAKE
A SMALL GAVEL AND A MEDIUM GAVEL
AND A BIG GAVEL, THERE IS ONLY
ONE GAVEL.
LARRY: THAT’S RIGHT.
>> WHETHER YOU TRANSFER THE
GAVEL WHETHER THE NEW SPEAKER
HAS 222 VOTES OR 242 VOTES, YOU
TRANSFERRED THE POWER TO
RECOGNIZE, THE POWER TO
SCHEDULE, THE POWER TO HAVE
COMMITTEE CHAIRS, THE POWER OF
INVESTIGATION, ALL OF THAT WILL
CHANGE ON JANUARY 3rd.
FRANKLY IT WILL BE WORTH THE
PRICE OF ADMISSION TO SEE
NANCY PELOSI IS STILL THERE, I
THINK SHE MAY NOT BE, TO WATCH
NANCY TO HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO
KEVIN, IT’S A HUGE CHANGE OF
POWER JUST AS IT WAS YOU
REMEMBER BACK IN ’94 WHEN WE FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS TOOK
THE MAJORITY.
I CAMPAIGNED WITH KEVIN BEFORE
THE ELECTION.
I WATCHED HIM WORK CROWD AFTER
CROWD.
HE RAISED $480 MILLION.
HE HAS GROWN THE PARTY IN TWO
CONSECUTIVE ELECTIONS GAINED
SEATS.
HE RECRUITED VETERANS,
MINORITIES, WOMEN.
I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY
DYNAMIC MEMBERSHIP AND FRANKLY,
I THINK WILL BE VERY, VERY
INTERESTING.
LARRY: THAT IS, YOU KNOW, THAT’S
WHAT I’M TRYING TO GET FOLKS TO
FOCUS ON, JUST ALL THE THINGS
YOU JUST SAID.
IT DOESN’T MATTER, IT IS NOT A
SMALL GAVEL OR A MEDIUM GAVEL,
IT’S A GAVEL.
THE MARGINS YOU CAN DO A LOT
WITH A SMALL MARGIN, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA.
THAT IS WHY I DON’T THINK PEOPLE
SHOULD GO OFF THE DEEP END.
WHY I’M GROWING BORED WITH ALL
THE RECRIME RECRIMINATIONS WHAT
NOT.
MOVE ON, LOOK AT OPPORTUNITY.
THAT IS WHAT YOU’RE SAYING.
THAT IS WHAT LAFFER SAID ABOUT
THE OPPORTUNITY.
LET US BE OPTIMISTS ABOUT THIS,
NEWT.
OPTIMISTS WHAT THE COUNTRY
NEEDS.
DOSE OF OPTIMISM.
GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.
>> I SAY IF YOU ADD TO THAT
ELECTING HERSCHEL WALKER IN THE
RUNOFF YOU GET BACK TO A
DIVISION OF POWER IN THE SENATE
THAT IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT.
THERE’S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
POWER SHARING WITH 50-50, AND
BEING IN THE MINORITY WITH 49.
SO, THAT IS ONE MORE SHOT HERE
AT US GETTING BACK ON OFFENSE.
IF HERSCHEL CAN WIN IT WILL BE A
BIG DIFFERENCE.
LARRY: WELL-SAID, NEWT GINGRICH.
WE NEED TO HEAR THAT.
WE NEED TO HEAR FROM SOME ONE
WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH IT.
THANK YOU.
LET’S TAKE OUT BIG GOVERNMENT
SOCIALISM.
YOU COINED IT.
I HAVE GONE WITH IT SIX, EIGHT,
