TODAY, EXACTLY TWO WEEKS AFTER
TODAY, EXACTLY TWO WEEKS AFTER
THE FBI SEARCHED DONALD TRUMP'S
MAR-A-LAGO RESIDENCE, THE EX
PRESIDENT IS SUING TO
TEMPORARILY BLOCKED THE FBI
FROM REVIEWING DOCUMENTS SEIZED
FROM HIS HOME.
THE MOTION FILED TODAY ASKED A
FEDERAL JUDGE TO IN POINT AND
INDEPENDENT SPECIAL MASTER TO
REVIEW MATERIAL SEIZED BY THE
GOVERNMENT.
THE MOTION IS 27 PAGES LONG.
IT ASKS THE DOJ PROVIDE
INVENTORY OF PROPERTY SEIZED BY
MAR-A-LAGO, AND ANY MATERIAL
THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE SCOPE
OF THE SEARCH RETURNED.
IT ALSO CONTAINS THE SAME
OPENLY THREATENING MESSAGE THAT
TRUMP HAD HIS LAWYER APPARENTLY
RELATE TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
LAWYER ON AUGUST 11TH.
IT READS, QUOTE, PRESIDENT
TRUMP WANTS THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL TO KNOW THAT HE HAS
BEEN HEARING FROM PEOPLE ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE
RAID.
IF THERE WAS ONE WORD TO
DESCRIBE THEIR MOOD, IT IS
ANGRY.
THE HEAT IS BUILDING UP.
THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING UP.
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO TAKE THE
HEAT DOWN, TO BRING THE
PRESSURE DOWN, JUST LET US
KNOW.
CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL IS A
DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA, A
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
HE JOINS ME NOW.
CONGRESSMAN, THIS SORT OF
THREAT WAS REPORTED, I BELIEVE,
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES EARLIER.
THE PRESIDENT COMMITTING IT TO
PRINT NOW IN A COURT FILING.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?
>> MERRICK GARLAND, CHRIS, IT'S
NOT GOING TO BE THREATENED.
THAT IS CLEARLY THE CASE HERE.
THIS IS A POSITION, IT'S ALSO
CLEAR HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN.
BUT THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP,
YOU KNOW, THROWING HIS WEIGHT
AROUND OR THROWN THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE, THEY'RE CLEARLY
OVER.
HE DOESN'T HAVE BILL BARR OR
WHITAKER JEFF SESSIONS, YOU
KNOW, TO DO HIS BIDDING
ANYMORE.
BUT WE DO NEED A FULL
ACCOUNTING OF, ONE MOST
IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DOCUMENTS DID
DONALD TRUMP HAVE THAT WHERE
TOP SECRET AND
COMPARTMENTALIZED.
TO, YOU KNOW, WHERE THESE
DOCUMENTS CAME INTO OTHER
INDIVIDUALS?
WHO ELSE HAD ACCESS?
WHERE THEY DIGITIZED.
I AM AFRAID THEY COULD'VE ALSO
BEEN UPLOADED INTO AN ONLINE
FORMAT.
THREE, WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP
INTERACTS OFTEN WITH FOREIGN
NATIONALS, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY
GIVEN OR PASSED AROUND, ORDERED
FOR NATIONALS HAVE ACCESS TO
THEM.
AND THEN WHY, WHY CRUSTED HE
HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS?
THEY SAY THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON
THE INTEL COMMITTEE ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE SAY IT IS FOR
HIS MEMOIR.
DONALD TRUMP JUST PUBLISHED A
PICTURE BOOK.
HE IS NOT WRITING A MEMOIR.
SO THE Y IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
HERE.
>> YEAH, I WILL PLAY MIKE
TURNER WHO HAS BEEN GOING
AROUND SORT OF DEFENDING THE
PRESIDENT MAKING THAT POINT,
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WHAT YOU GET A FORMER
PRESIDENT HAVE FOUR CLASSIFIED
OR TOP SECRET INFORMATION ONCE
HE HAS LEFT OFFICE?
WHY BRING IT HOME WITH HIM?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM.
BUT CERTAINLY WE ALL KNOW THAT
EVERY FORMER PRESIDENT HAS
ACCESS TO THEIR DOCUMENTS, IT
IS HOW THEY WRITE THEIR
MEMOIRS.
THEY DON'T HAVE, YOU KNOW,
GREAT RECALL OF EVERYTHING THAT
HAS OCCURRED IN THEIR
ADMINISTRATION.
>> I SHOULD NOTE, AGAIN, THAT
IS MIKE TURNER ON THE COMMITTEE,
YOU ARE CALLING ON THAT
COMMITTEE.
NEW YORK TIMES, APPARENTLY JUST
REPORTING JUST NOW, TO YOUR
POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER, THE
SCOPE OF THIS.
THERE WERE 300 CLASSIFIED
DOCUMENTS, APPARENTLY AT
MAR-A-LAGO.
WHICH, AGAIN --
>> JEEZ.
>> YEAH, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THAT NUMBER.
>> YEAH, THAT IS A LOT.
JUST FOR YOUR VIEWERS SAKE, THE
REASON WHY THEY ARE MARKED TOP
SECRET MEANS THAT IT OFTEN
RELATES TO FORCED PROTECTION
FOR OUR TROOPS.
YOU KNOW, INFORMATION ABOUT
WHERE OUR TROOPS ARE THAT WE
WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE TO KNOW
BECAUSE IT WOULD PUT THEM IN
HARM'S WAY.
IT CAN RELATE TO OUR NUCLEAR
POSTURE OR THE NUCLEAR POSTURE
OF OUR ADVERSARIES.
IT CAN RELATE TO THE TECHNICAL
MEANS THAT WE USED TO COLLECT
INFORMATION, TO PROTECT OUR
TROOPS AND PROTECT AMERICANS.
OR THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING
TO COMBAT TERRORISM.
SO 300 PAGES, YOU KNOW, JUST A
BASEMENT STAIRWAY AWAY IN AN
OPEN, YOU KNOW, BEACH HOUSE.
IT IS NOT WHERE YOU WOULD WANT
THAT INFORMATION.
ESPECIALLY IN THE HANDS OF
SOMEONE WHO PRESIDENT BIDEN
DEEMED SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ABLE
TO RECEIVE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION.
>> THERE WERE SOME REPORTS
EARLIER TODAY THAT THE GANG OF
AI WHICH IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE
THAT HAVE SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE
OVERSIGHT DUTIES UNDER STATUTE
WANTED TO BE BRIEFED,
ESSENTIALLY, ON THE MAR-A-LAGO
DOCUMENTS.
YOUR COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN
ADAM SCHIFF WHO IS THE CHAIR OF
THAT INTEL COMMITTEE SEEM TO
KNOCK THAT DOWN TODAY.
I WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID AND
GET YOUR REACTION.
>> THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THE
GANG OF EIGHT REQUESTED A
BRIEFING ON THE AFFIDAVIT OR
THE OTHER MATERIALS.
THERE IS NO REQUEST THAT I AM
AWARE OF THAT HAS COME FROM US,
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE
CANDIDATE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN
LEARNING MORE.
>> ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT FOLKS
CAN BE TRUSTED, YOUR COLLEAGUES
CAN BE TRUSTED WITH A BRIEFING
SUCH OF THIS, GIVEN SOME
EVIDENCE THAT, FOR INSTANCE IN
THE PAST, I BELIEVE RICHARD
BURR, IS SAID TO HAVE FILLED
THE WHITE HOUSE IN AFTER A
CONFIDENTIAL FBI BRIEFING.
>> NO, I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE
SHOWED THEMSELVES THAT THAT IF
THEY ARE GIVEN CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION, THEY WILL USE IT
TO PROTECT, THEY WILL
MANIPULATE WHAT IT IS, OR THEY
WILL PERVERT THE INFORMATION TO
PROTECT DONALD TRUMP.
SO I THINK WHAT MR. SCHIFF WAS
PROBABLY LOOKING TO, YOU KNOW,
IF THIS IS AN ACTIVE ONGOING
INVESTIGATION, OF COURSE AS
CUSTODIANS OF CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION AND INDIVIDUAL
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.
WE WANT TO KNOW WITH THE
BATTLEFIELD ASSESSMENT IS OF
WHERE AND WHEN, WE ALSO DON'T
WANT TO JEOPARDIZE AN
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.
BY THE WAY, CHRIS, ALL OF THE
MOVES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AS
IT RELATES TO THIS
INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN AT THE
REQUEST OF DONALD TRUMP.
THE FBI DIDN'T PUBLICIZE THE
SERVED.
THEY'RE ALL TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGE
THE SEARCH HIMSELF.
THE FBI WAS NOT THE ONE THAT
SAID LET'S MAKE ALL THIS PUBLIC,
DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT THE
SHUTTLE BIBLICAL.
SO MERRICK GARLAND IN THE DOJ
SAID FINE.
NOW IT IS DONALD TRUMP WHO
WANTS THE AFFIDAVIT TO BE OUT
THERE.
SO EVERY DAMAGING PIECE OF
INFORMATION THAT HURTS DONALD
