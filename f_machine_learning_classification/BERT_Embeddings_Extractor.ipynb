            "At exam time it is important to sleep well. Today we have Doctor Baker with us in the studio and he is going to give us five top tips for getting a good night's sleep. Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. Thank you. It's great to be here. Let's start with tip one. Don't go to bed with the television on. Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don't really sleep well, so turn it off! Don't think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening. Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep. Don't play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy and active. Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can't wait until the morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room. Play music if you like. But don't play it too loud. Turn the sound down low. Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners.\n",

I think he's drinking lemonade. He's always thirsty. Who's that girl on the bike? The one with the short blonde hair? No, not her. The one who's laughing. Oh, that's Sally. She's my best friend.

And sometimes they go out when it's dark. They look at the moon when there are no clouds in the sky. Do people have to bring anything to the club meetings? Pens and paper? No, but it's a good idea to bring a torch. It'll be dark outside and they must be careful when they go out. And what happens if it's a cloudy night and you can't see anything? Do the children watch TV programmes? No Michael. But the club has some very interesting DVDs. So we watch those on nights like that. Oh good! I'll enjoy that! And a friend of mine from the university sometimes comes to talk about space in the future. His name's Mr Bailey. How do you spell his surname? B-A-I-L-E-Y. He's very famous! He's written lots of books.\n",
            "You've got some lovely things in this room, Uncle Robert. Where did you get that painting? The one of the mountain? Well, in my job, I have to go to lots of different places. I found it in a market that I visited last year. It wasn't expensive. I was quite surprised. It's so beautiful! Those gloves look very warm, Uncle Robert. Who gave you those? I can't remember but I got them when I had to visit a factory. Someone gave them to me when I left. I don't wear them because they're too small. Can I have them? Sure! And wow! That fan looks like a rainbow! When did you buy that? When I was working in a castle. The building was six hundred years old! You could buy all kinds of things there. I might give it to your grandmother. What's your favourite thing here? Well, I heard some really great music at a theatre I travelled to. Later, at the airport, I found a shop that sold drums. They were just like the ones a man played in the concert. So you bought them! Yes. I love them but your aunt says they're too noisy!And this is a birthday present for your mother. I had a meeting in a nice town in the middle of a forest last week. There's a little store there full of interesting things! It's made of glass! Be careful with it. Don't worry! Mum loves swans! I'm sure she'll like it. Why haven't you opened this box of chocolates? Are they a present, too? Yes! I was waiting for you to arrive! I had some in my favourite café in London. They tasted so good! These are the same. They're for you. I got them from the hotel where I stayed last night. Wow! Thanks!\n",
            "You've had many different jobs, haven't you, Grandma? Yes, Jack. I was a secretary for many years but I didn't like it much. Weren't you a nurse too? That was only for a short time when I was very young. Did you like doing that? Yes, but I think I enjoyed working in the chemist's in my village most of all. I've got a new job now, Jack. In a museum. I'm going to start today! So where is this museum? Is it the one next to my school? No, not that one. I know! Is it that big one opposite the hospital? No, it's the one in the park. Wow! My class is going to visit that museum next month! I enjoy visiting museums. That's good. Do you like drawing the things that you can see there? Yes, but I like finding out about different things most of all. There's always something interesting to read. I agree. I'd like to pick things up and hold them too, but you can't do that in every museum, can you? No, that's right, Jack. It's a very exciting museum. You can learn a lot about history there. Are there any dinosaurs? No. The most interesting thing in the museum is a boat that sailed all round the world 400 years ago. Wow! What else? Well, there are a lot of old gold and silver things. Some of them are 1,000 years old! But what are you going to do there? Are you going to work in the shop there? No. I wanted to sell food to people who are visiting. That's a nice job. Yes, but they asked me to do something different, I'm going to show children who visit the museum interesting things and explain the history to them. That's excellent. You're very clever, Grandma! Are you going to take the bus to the museum every day? No, it's sometimes too slow. What about a taxi? That's very quick. Yes, but it's too expensive. So what will you do? I'll take the train. That's the best way to get there.\n",
            "I went to a city like this on vacation last year. There were lots of high buildings next to the river there, too! Oh! Well, would you like to colour some of this picture? Sure!

The one on the ground by the entrance to the building? Yes, please. OK. How about making that blue? Good idea! Use that colour I'd like you to write something here too, please. OK. I hope it's not a long word! Don't worry! Write a name on the front of the boat for me. OK. What do you want me to call it? 'Sunny', like the weather! That's an excellent name. OK! Can I do some more colouring? I'm quite good at that. Of course! The boy who's looking over the bridge has got a backpack on his back. Yes, Do you want me to colour that, then? Only its pocket, nothing else. Make it orange. I love that colour. So do I. All right! I can do that. I'd like you to write something else now. We need a name for the hotel, too. OK. That's a good idea. Well, there's a board above its double doors. Can you see it? It's got plants on it. Write it there. All right. We'll call it 'Star' hotel - lots of famous people stay there! OK! That sounds good. I'll write that now. Thank you. And perhaps you should colour one of the flags before we finish. The one at the back of the boat? I don't think so. Colour the one in the park, by the path, please. What colour? You've got a yellow pencil, I think. Use that one! OK. There! I've finished. Great!\n",

That man doesn't look very happy! Oh, you mean William? Well, he was asleep, but he woke up when the volleyball hit him on the head! What's he saying? Please be more careful next time, I think, Can you see that boy? The one who's falling into the water? No the other one who's just pushed him. The boy in the blue shorts. That's my cousin, Oliver. Well he isn't very kind. Oh, it's OK. They're only playing. And look. Daisy's here too. She's trying to make those flies go away I think. They like ice cream! I didn't mean the girl in the swimsuit. I meant the one who's holding the net. Oh, her. Right. I see. I think she's going to go fishing. And what's that boy's name? Which boy? The boy with the shell. Is he collecting them? Perhaps. He's got a big smile on his face. He's called Jack. Right. Let's go and talk to him. OK.\n",
            "Dad. The man from the 'New Homes' office phoned today. He wanted to speak to you. Oh, yes. Was it about a house which someone wants to sell? Yes, that's right. And it sounds really cool! Well, we might buy it. Where is the house? I mean, what's the address? It's number 12 Princes Street. How do you spell the name of the street? I want to write it down. It's P-R-I-N-C-E-S. I don't know that street. Is it near the train station? That's important for me. No, it isn't. It's near the library. It's a nice quiet street, he said. My friend Jane lives near there and she likes it very much. How many bedrooms has it got? It's got three. And - listen to this! - there are two bathrooms: a big one upstairs and a smaller one downstairs. Well, that's good for us. Is there a garden? Yes, there is. And is there a swimming pool in the garden? No, Dad. There's a swing in it. Mm. It sounds nice. How much is it? The man didn't tell me. But my friend Jane says, He didn't tell you? But that's the most important thing. Well, is it expensive? Sorry, Dad, I don't know. But there's something else, something great, What? The house has got a music room! Has it? Well, that's something different. Where is it? It's in the basement. I could play my pop music and drums really loudly! Yes, you could. Mm, well, let's go and look at this house, shall we?\n",
            "Can you tell me something about the art competition, Peter? Yes, of course. There were 25 paintings when we started, and I've chosen six. They're all excellent, so it's very difficult to choose just one. What about this picture? The table with the bowl of fruit in the middle of it? That's Mr Green's. I could eat that large piece of cheese, it looks so good. The light in the painting is excellent too, isn't it? Yes. I like this picture of the old castle. Whose is this? Ah, let me see, That's one of Mrs Cook's. She started painting it in the morning but then it began to rain. So she had to finish it later, That's right. In her hotel room. Tell me about this picture, here. The fields look lovely in the summer sun, don't they? Yes! It looks like a brilliant place for a picnic, no houses or streets, I think that's one of the best pictures by Mrs West that I've ever seen. And what do you think of this one? What's it called? A Day at the Races. The artist, Miss Richards, has a lot of dogs at home which she enjoys painting, but this is the first time she's tried painting horses. Well I think it's really good. So do I. This one is a favourite. I can understand that. But snow isn't easy to paint. Mountains are really difficult too. Yes, but Mr Bridges didn't have to worry about that, here. No. And the kids are having lots of fun. Look! Yes! Oh, I'm very interested in this one. Yes, me too. Mrs Hill's very good at painting water. Who's the person in the lake? Her husband! It looks wonderful there. Thanks for showing me all the paintings. Well done to everyone.\n",
            "Frank! What are you doing? Are you playing video games again? No, Mum. I'm tidying the living room. Oh. Are you? Well, that's great, but please come upstairs and help me. Why? I'm putting your clothes in the suitcase. Have you forgotten? We're going to go on holiday today! Which shirt do you want to take on holiday? Well, I don't want that striped one - it's too small now. Mm. You're right. What about this one with the butterflies on it? No, thanks. I hate that shirt. I want to take that black one. For a holiday in the sun? Oh, Frank! Have you seen the plane tickets, Frank? I can't find them. I saw them this morning. They were on the shelf in your room, I think. Well, they're not there now. Have you looked in your handbag? Yes, of course I have. Oh, here they are - on the desk, next to this book! What time is it now? It's quarter past ten. We have to meet Dad at the airport at 1.30. No later. Are we going to take a taxi there? Yes. It will arrive here at 12 o'clock. We must be ready then. Mrs Hill will be here soon. We have to talk about the pets. She is going to look after them? No, her son, Michael, is going to do it. Why can't Grandpa do it? Oh, Frank, he can't come here every day. It's too far. Are we going to have lunch here, Mum? No, it's too early. We can have it on the plane. Can't we buy something at the airport? We'll be very hungry. We won't have time, Frank. You'll be OK - you had a lot to eat this morning!\n",
            "Can I colour this picture, please? Yes, of course, Betty. Can you see the cloud? The one that's in front of the sun? That's right. Colour that yellow. OK. The man's looking at the penguins, I think. They're so funny. Can I colour one of those next? Yes. Colour the one that's standing on the top of the rock. Use grey for that. All right. There! I think it's waving with its wings! I think the octopus looks scary! Do you? Perhaps the larger one does. Well let's colour the smaller one. Cool! Green? No, let's make it pink, this time. All right. I've got that colour here. Brilliant. How about some writing now? Look at the boat. OK. One word is missing there, isn't it? Yes! Above the words 'of the Sea' there's a space. In that space, write the word QUEEN. Can you do that? Sure! That's a good name for a boat. Can I write something else, too? Yes. What would you like to write? Well, I'd like to write something on the treasure box, in that square. GOLD? Yes! I was thinking the same as you! Do you think they'll find it? I don't know, And now for some more colouring. Can I colour the spotted fish? The little one. It looks really sweet. I agree, but colour the striped one for me please, instead. No problem. Can I use purple? Yes. Good idea. Thank you. Fantastic.\n",
            "Are you going to go to the party tonight, Julia?  I'd love to, but I can't. I couldn't go to school when I was ill last week, so I have a lot of homework to do.  But you are feeling better?  Much better, but I still feel tired.\n",
            "Annie! I tried to phone you on Saturday afternoon, but your phone was off. Sorry, Tony! I was at home all morning and in the evening. Oh, so what did you do on Saturday? I went to see a film actually. But before that I was at the shops for about two hours. Then I went to the cinema for the 3.15 show and I didn't come out until half past five. What was the film? An old one from many years ago called 'The Black Lions'. It's the story of a top basketball player. Did you enjoy it? Actually, it's an interesting story, but it's a shame there are no really good actors in it. Anyway, it's not too long! Don't you prefer funny films? Well, my favourite film ever is 'Bird Boy', which actually isn't funny and has nothing amazing in it. But the reason I love it is because it all really happened. Oh. I haven't seen it. I've only seen it on TV. I think it's best to see films on a big cinema screen, but I usually just watch them on my laptop at home. Me too.\n",
            "I'm very pleased with your work. You're getting good marks and working together well. But you really must remember that other classes in rooms near us can't do their work if you shout at one another. Let's all show a bit more respect for other people - OK? Now - everyone has something to finish. Don't hurry, you have lots of time.\n",
            "That was great, wasn't it? Yes - everyone did really well today but I'm exhausted now and my legs really hurt! I'm going to go straight home and ask mum if I can have a pizza for dinner. I'm going to lie on my bed and listen to music all evening. Good idea! We've done so much exercise today!\n",
            "I'm afraid you need to do this maths homework again, Sarah. Oh no! Didn't I finish it, Mr Hall? I'm sure I did! So - are some of my answers incorrect? Not at all. You understood my lesson perfectly - but I told you to do exercise two on page six, not page sixteen! Oh dear - I must be much more careful!\n",
            "Let's see your new bag, Lara. Oh, why did you get that one? You wanted a pale colour. I know! But this was the only one in the shop that was big enough for all my school stuff! Right. Well, it looks good. Did it cost a lot? Yeah, much too much. Mum had to lend me some money.\n",
            "What time is it, Maria? It's half past two. Why? I want to go to that extra art lesson this afternoon. It starts at three, doesn't it? It's starting now and you're late! Be quick because it finishes at half past three.\n",
            "Have you looked out of the window this morning, Kate? Why, Dad? What do you mean? You won't need your warm coat today. The weather forecast says the temperature's definitely going to be higher than yesterday. Great. I'm going to the city centre with Diana this morning. But take an umbrella because it's just starting to rain. All right, no problem.\n",
            "We're having a fashion show at school again, Great. What are you helping with, Julia? I'm doing the make-up. I want it to be really good. That will be fun. Anton wanted to have special lights but the teacher says we don't need them. So he's finding CDs to play in the show. Oh. Emma chose really good music last year but she wants to take some pictures with her new camera this time. Karl's a good photographer too, isn't he? Yes, but he's drawing some posters. He's brilliant at art. Is Sarah helping? She's deciding what everyone will wear. Oh, will she be good at that? She was so good at selling tickets last time. Well, she's very interested in fashion now. Will there be a party afterwards? George is going to get some snacks. It's difficult to know how many we'll need because we haven't sold many tickets yet. I'll buy one, how much are they...?\n",
            "I've just been to the new skate park. It's great! Really, Chloe. I'm going there on Saturday. I'm going to go by bike. Do you want to come too? I'd really like to but I'm playing in the school basketball team on that day. Why don't you ask Pete, he's got a new skateboard. Okay, I will.\n",
            "Would you like to see a film this evening? How much are the tickets? I haven't got much money this week. All tickets tonight are four pounds thirty for students like us. Usually they're five pounds eighty. Let's go then. I've got seven pounds sixty to spend. We can have a coffee afterwards.\n",
            "Will someone meet you when you arrive at the airport, Peter? Yes. My parents will be at work, but my older sister will. She's just passed her driving test! That's good news. And my grandfather lives near the airport so we're going to visit him on the way home. That's nice.\n",
            "Morning everyone. I hope you're all looking forward to our camping trip next week. Please remember that now we are staying an extra day the trip costs thirty nine pounds, not thirty four. You need to give your money to our new school secretary by the end of the week. Her name is Mrs Fairford. That's F A I R F O R D. Please go to see her soon. As you know, we are leaving on Tuesday but we're returning on Friday instead of Thursday. Now - you must get to school for half past seven on Tuesday because we'll leave at a quarter to eight and we can't wait for anyone. We usually go travel by coach bus on school trips but because the campsite is near a station, we're going to go by train for a change. You don't need to bring tents or anything like that, but you will need boots. We will do lots of walking by rivers so don't bring trainers because your feet will get wet. Is that clear to everyone?\n",
            "Hi Claire. Are you in the city centre? Hi Alex. Yes, I'm just having a sandwich in the café. How about you? I'm at the museum, looking at a really great art exhibition. Why don't you come and meet me here? OK, but just for an hour. I've got to go to the hairdresser's at 2. Can I speak to Fred Warner, please? He's in a meeting now. I'll ask him to call you at quarter past ten when he comes out. I'm seeing a customer then. I can phone at twelve o'clock. He'll be in another meeting then. Call at half past before he goes for lunch. OK. Shall we have a party this month? A Friday night is best. How about July the eighteenth? I have to work late that day. The eleventh will be better. We've got theatre tickets for then. Are we doing anything on the twenty-fifth? That's fine. Let's make it then. The eleventh is too soon anyway. Did you have a good picnic yesterday? It was so sunny and hot! Yes, but we almost didn't go because the television weatherman was talking about rain. So did you take umbrellas with you? Yes, but of course we didn't use them. It's good we didn't go today - there's such a strong wind! Excuse me, are these shorts in the sale? Yes, sir. Everything on that shelf is five pounds. I'll take this shirt too. That's fifteen pounds, so with the shorts that will be twenty pounds.\n",
            "Hi Laura. Some of us are going for a weekend in Dublin this year. Are you free at the beginning of next month? Yes, I'd love to come. Great! Who else is going? I asked my cousins, but they're playing in a tennis competition - so there'll be four of us from my office, and you. Where are we staying? I tried to book a guest-house. It was full, but visitors can rent rooms in the university during the holidays. We'll do that - it's cheaper than a hotel. Excellent. Are you taking your new camera? Yes, some maps of the city too. But you'll need a coat! It often rains. OK! Have you been before? Yes! The centre's busy - the shops are always full of people! My friends and I loved all the beautiful buildings - I really enjoyed learning about their history. Yeah! So, are you excited about the trip? Yeah but it's a pity the music festival won't be on. When I'm in Dublin I always have lots of fish - it's fantastic. There's a new art exhibition - you might like it, but I'm not interested. Yeah, maybe!\n",
            "So, you've got a motorbike, Sally? Yeah, what do you think? Cool! Thanks! I paid quite a lot for it, but I'll be able to get to college in ten minutes now. Remember how I was always late last year? And you were always having to* repair your old bicycle, weren't you? Yeah. It was just too slow, really.\n",
            "So do you think you'll enjoy university? Yes, especially the trips! I loved science at school, but I won't need it much. I thought about studying history but couldn't find a course I really liked. We're learning about mountains and rivers in the first term, which'll be great. And I'm looking forward to* finding out about cities and how they've developed* over time.\n",
            "What a great photo! Thanks! They were all moving around so quickly - running and jumping about. Is that a group of mothers over there? Yes, and the little ones were all ready to go home. Their lessons were over for the day. It was raining, but they just wanted to run around after being indoors for so many hours.\n",
            "I feel so upset! I can't see it anywhere. It probably fell out of my bag on the way to the station. I can't buy a ticket now! I'm going back to work to ask if anybody has seen it, or can lend me some money. I have an appointment for an eye test* this afternoon - I'll be late now!\n",
            "Did you buy something nice, Kate? Yes, David, I'm delighted! We're having a special meal tomorrow for my sister's birthday. My cousin's cooking and we'll play some board games afterwards. The whole family will be there and I want to look nice. Sure! I wanted something green, and this is so comfortable! Of course we'll all argue* about the games!\n",
            "Are you nearly ready for your birthday party on Saturday, Maria? I think so, Simon. I've made a cake and my friends are bringing the other food. That's a good idea. Barbara's going to bring some oranges and grapes. And I'll bring some bread and cheese from the market if you like. Everyone gets hungry at parties, don't they? Thanks, Simon. But you don't need to bring bread because Anita's bringing that. She wanted to bring ice cream but I think the weather's too cold! Mm, it is. Perhaps Peter can help. He likes cooking, doesn't he? Yes, he emailed me and asked me to choose roast chicken or fish. I chose chicken because it's more popular than fish. What do you think? That sounds great! What's Michael bringing - he's coming, isn't he? Yes, he loves parties! I telephoned him and he's going to make a big bowl of sliced tomatoes and onions. Lovely!\n",
            "Several students from this college went to work for Sunshine Holidays last year and enjoyed it. So I'm going to give you some information about working in their summer camps this year. The camps start on the fifteenth of June so you must be free from then until August the twentieth. Most students then spend September travelling around and having a holiday before they come home. The camps are for children who are between ten and fifteen years old and to work there you have to be nineteen. So that's OK for most of you. You don't need to be good at sports or languages but they only want people who can drive. That's because you'll take the children out on trips by car. Each week you'll get sixty-five pounds, so you could save over five hundred pounds during your time there. If you're interested, you need to write a letter and send it with a photo to Sunshine Holidays. So, does anyone have any questions,?\n",
            "You have two new messages. Message number one, received today at 3.45 p.m. Hi, it's me. How's it going? I guess you're at work and you don't have your phone on, right? First of all, thank you, THANK YOU for the birthday card and message. I received it this morning. That's so nice of you. I'm organising a little party for my birthday. It's nothing very big - only a few of my best and closest friends. That means you too! We're going to have it at my cousin's house. She lives in the countryside in a nice big house with a swimming pool. I'd love to see you there. It's going to be this Friday. I'll send you the instructions on how to get there later, OK? Anyway, have fun at work. Don't work too hard, OK? Talk soon. You have two new messages. Message number two, received today at 5.15 p.m. Aw, you're still not answering your phone! OK, here are the instructions to get to my cousin's house for the party. Are you going to take your car? If you take the car, drive straight on Forest Road until you get to the motorway. Drive past Brownsville and take exit 13A. That's 13A. You drive down the road there and turn left. It's the first big house on the right. OK? If you're taking a bus, you can get the number 80 to Brownsville. Call me when you get there and somebody can pick you up in a car. I can't wait. This is going to be so great!\n",
            "Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual. I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time. Don't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that - I know how much you all love working late! The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month. OK. That's it? Are there any questions?\n",
            "One day... One day... One day One day I want to become a lawyer. One day I am going to be a world-class fashion designer. One day I will be a renowned cake artist. One day I will be the poet whose voice births the new Nigerian. One day I'm going to be a dancer. And one day I'm going to be a singer. One day I'll cook alongside one of the greatest chefs in the world. One day I want to be a businesswoman. One day I will build a catering company to serve the entire world. Some day I would love to be a doctor.\n",
            "Hello and welcome to LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number two. I'm Tess. And I'm Ravi. We're the presenters and we're here in the studio with our producer, Gordon. Hi Gordon! Hello! And he'll be back later with another one of his. erm, jokes. Now, last week I told you that Tess loved riding her mountain bike and you've been away riding your bike this week, haven't you. I have, yes. Where did you go? We went to the Lake District, in the North West. Oh. Beautiful. For our listeners who don't know, the Lake District is in the north west of England and it's a really beautiful part of the country. I went there last year, you know. It's a difficult place to ride a bike though - lots of hills. I like riding up hills! I prefer riding down them. Did you stay in hotels? No, we were camping. We took two small tents with us and at the end of every day we just put the tents up on a camp site. It was great. Really relaxing. What was the weather like? Camping's great when the weather's OK but when it's raining. it's horrible. Yeah, we were really lucky. It was really sunny. Well, it rained one day but that was OK. Sounds great - I need a holiday! But, well, I think I prefer to spend my holidays on the beach. It sounds like a lot of hard work Tess. I love it! I'm going again next year. I can't wait! But it's time to move on to the rest of the show - I know we've got lots of interesting people to hear from. I'd like to meet So, let's start with our 'I'd like to meet' section. In this part of the show we ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And of course, we ask them to explain why. Our guest today on 'I'd like to meet' is Yasmin from Cardiff. Hello Yasmin and welcome to the show. Hello. It's nice to be here. Hello Yasmin. Can you tell us something about yourself? Well, erm, my name's Yasmin, I'm 18 years old, I live in Cardiff - that's in Wales - and I'm training to be a beauty therapist. Hmm. A beauty therapist! That's a great job. Now I'm going to ask the question. So Yasmin, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? Oh, I'd like to meet Shakira. Shakira. This'll be interesting. Can you tell us something about her? Sure. She's a singer - and a dancer too - she's from Colombia and she sings in Spanish and English. And why did you choose Shakira to talk about today? Erm, for quite a lot of reasons. First, I think she's a fantastic singer. I just fell in love with her voice the first time I heard her sing. It's so different. And then, she writes her own songs - she wrote her first song when she was only 8 I think. I love singing and I write my own songs too, so I understand how difficult it is - and I'd love to sit down with her and write a song together. I'm sure she could teach me a lot. Can you play any musical instruments? The guitar and the piano. In the beginning she wrote songs and sang in Spanish, and she was very famous in Latin America, but she didn't speak English, so she had to learn it. And I think she learnt it really well. I admire her because she didn't just translate her old songs from Spanish to English - she wrote new ones in English. It isn't easy to write songs in a foreign language, but her words are great I think. She still sings in Spanish too - she records two versions of her songs, one in English and one in Spanish. Another reason I like her is because she's a mixture of different cultures, and that makes her music interesting. Her mother is from Colombia but her father is Lebanese, so there's a lot of Arabic influence in her music - and not only Arabic - there's Indian, Brazilian, Iranian - she's interested in all sorts of music. And I think she's a nice person too. Her videos are very, well you know, sexy, but I don't think she's really like that - she's got four dogs and she likes working in her garden, and she doesn't drink alcohol and she doesn't smoke. Thanks Yasmin. Erm, one more question. What would you like to talk to Shakira about, if you could meet her? Oh, lots of things. Like I said before, I'd like to ask her about how she writes her songs. And I'd like her to teach me how to dance. She's an incredible dancer. She certainly is! Thanks Yasmin, that was great. I think I'd really like to meet Shakira too. Mmm. I'm sure you would, Ravi. Have you ever met anyone famous? No, I don't think so. Only you, Tess. Right, listeners, remember that we'd like to hear from you. Which famous person, dead or alive, would you like to meet? And why? Email us at 'learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org, that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - at- britishcouncil - all one word DOT org, that's o-r-g. Let us know which famous person you would like to meet and you could appear on the programme. Quiz OK, now it's quiz time. This week we're going to play Hot Seat, and here to play are Ben and Poppy.

And if any of you listening have a good game we can play in quiz time, write to us and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org. We'd love to hear your ideas for games we can play. Our person in... OK, now it's time for 'Our Person In'. This is the part of the show where we hear from people in different countries around the world. This week we're going to listen to Rachel Glover - Rachel is Our Woman in Argentina. I came to live in Buenos Aires, the capital city of Argentina, in 1998. On my first night in this beautiful city I went for a walk in the streets near my new flat. In a small square, close to my home, I heard music. I went to have a look, and for the first time I saw people dancing the tango. The tango is a dance that Argentina gave to the world - but no-one knows exactly when or where people first danced the tango - or even where the word 'tango' comes from. At the start of the twentieth century the population of Buenos Aires got much bigger as people arrived from all over the world to start a new life in South America. More than a million people came from Africa and from Europe - Spain, Italy, France, Russia, Poland. The tango began around this time. For me, the dance shows both the sadness of these people who had said goodbye to their homes and also the hope of new start in Argentina. An Argentinian friend told me that you have to learn the tango if you want to understand Argentina. I decided to learn this beautiful dance. I went to a tango school in the centre of Buenos Aires and joined a class. I was very surprised to find that my teacher was not Argentinian but Scottish. Her name was Claire Flanagan - she came to Buenos Aires 15 years ago - because of her love for tango. “I fell in love with the tango and now I've fallen in love with Buenos Aires” she says. Great. Can you dance the tango, Tess? No I can't. I'd love to learn. We can learn together. Your turn OK then. And don't forget that you can write in and tell us something interesting about your city or town. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org. Right. Earlier, we listened to Yasmin talking about Shakira. Remember Yasmin told us that Shakira records two versions of her songs - one in Spanish and one in English. For this week's Your Turn we asked some students in London this question - 'What do you prefer - songs in English or songs in your language?' Good one. Songs in English or songs in your own language. Let's hear what they said. I prefer songs in English because I watch MTV all the time and the songs I like are always in English. Russian songs - I come from Russia - are not as good to dance to as songs in English. And it can help me learn English too! I like some songs in English and some songs in Japanese but I think I like songs in Japanese best because the words are very important to me. In English songs you can't always hear all the words or you don't understand some words but when I listen to Japanese songs I can really understand the meaning of the song. I really like rap music so I listen to a lot of music in English - mostly American music. There are some singers in Germany who rap in German but it doesn't sound very good to me. I don't think German is a good language for rapping. I learn some new English words from rap music but I think some of them are words I can't say in the classroom! I come from Mexico and I like songs in Spanish best because I think a lot of the songs I hear in English are a bit stupid I mean it's only “I love you, baby”, or “I wanna dance with you baby”. The songs I listen to in Spanish are better because the words are about real things and feelings. Well, I think it's a strange question. It's too difficult to answer. It depends. Sometimes I like to listen to songs in English and I study the words and learn some new things but sometimes I just listen to songs in Greek where I understand all the words. I like some songs in English and some songs in Greek. If the music's good - I like it! Interesting. What sort of music do you like, Tess? Oh, I listen to all kinds of music, but I love music I can dance to. And always in English? Usually, yeah. How about you, listeners? Do you prefer songs in English or songs in your own language? Why not send us an email and let us know? You can send your emails to us at learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org - we'd love to hear from you. Carolina Right, now it's time to meet Carolina again. Remember that Carolina is from Venezuela. She's come to Britain to live, study and, she hopes, have a good time - and we're going with her! She speaks very good English, but this is her first visit to Britain, so some things are very strange for her. Last time we heard Carolina at the immigration desk at the airport where they checked her passport. Next, Carolina went to collect her suitcase but, unfortunately, her suitcase didn't appear. Oh. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Lost Luggage Office is please? It's over there. That desk over there, near the exit. Thank you. Hello. Erm.. My bag hasn't arrived. What do I have to do? OK. Where have you arrived from? From Venezuela. Caracas. And you're sure that your bag isn't on the carousel? I'm sure. I've waited for an hour. All the other people on my flight have gone. There are no more bags coming out. Hmm. OK. We'll need to fill in a report. Can I have your name please? It's Carolina. And my surname is. OK. Now we need a description of the bag. Can you tell me what it looks like? Erm, it's a black suitcase. Quite big. Look at these pictures. Which one looks most like your suitcase? Erm, this one, I think. The biggest one? Yes, I think so. And is it all black? The handle as well? Yes, everything. A black suitcase and a black handle. OK. Anything else? Yes. There was a label on it. With my name. And there's a little white star on the top, next to the handle. So I can see that it's mine. Little..white star. OK. Anything else? No. I think that's everything. OK. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll find it. Can you wait a few minutes while I make some calls? OK. Thank you. Oh! Poor Carolina. I hope they found her bag. Me too. We'll hear more next time but that's almost everything for today before we listen to Tom, our English teacher. Just time for one more thing. Gordon! Yes, here I am. OK then Gordon, let's hear your joke for today. OK. It's a camping joke. Tess, you'll love it. Come on then. Well, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are on a camping trip in the countryside. Late at night, Holmes and Watson are lying on their backs looking up at all the stars in the sky. Sherlock Holmes says, “Doctor Watson, look at all the stars and tell me what important question we have to ask.” Doctor Watson says, “Well, OK. There are millions and millions of stars in the sky. No-one knows exactly how many. There are planets out there that no-one has seen with a telescope. Maybe there is a planet somewhere that is just like Earth. I think the question we have to ask is, “Is there life in another part of our universe?” And Sherlock Holmes says, “Watson, you idiot! The question we have to ask is “WHERE IS OUR TENT?” That's quite good, actually Gordon. Not bad. Well that really is all we've got time for. We have to go now but don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our studio English teacher. After every podcast, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, don't go away, but we'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Bye! Don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org. Hello again. I'm Tom. At the end of every programme I'll talk about some of the language you heard in the programmes and talk about ways to help you learn English. Let's start by looking at something Carolina said. Listen to how she asked for directions. Oh. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Lost Luggage Office is please? It's over there. That desk over there, near the exit. When she asked for directions Carolina said “Can you tell me where the Lost Luggage Office is, please?”. But that isn't the only way to ask for directions. Can you think of other ways? Carolina could also say “Can you tell me the way to the lost luggage office, please?” or “Can you tell me how to get to the lost luggage office, please?”. There are different ways to ask for directions - you might know some other ways. One thing though that's very important is that Carolina asked politely. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Lost Luggage Office is please? Carolina said “Excuse me” and “please” when she asked. In Britain we say 'please' and 'thank you' a lot. We're very polite! Some people might not be very happy if you forget to say 'please' and 'thank you' so try to remember it. Now, Carolina used 'Can you tell me' to ask for directions but we heard 'can' in other parts of the programme too. Listen. Great. Can you dance the tango Tess? No I can't. I'd love to learn. And Tess asked Yasmin Can you play any musical instruments? Ravi said “Can you dance the tango?” and Tess asked “Can you play any musical instruments?” In these questions 'can' is used to talk about ability - 'I can swim', 'I can play the piano'. When Carolina asked for directions - 'Can you tell me?', 'can' is used as a request - when you ask someone to do something. We use 'can' to talk about ability and we also use it to make a request. Let's listen again to how Ravi introduced the Hot Seat game. OK, great. Now, I'll explain how to play Hot Seat and then we can start. OK? These cards have all got words on. One of you has to explain the words and the other one has to guess them. Ravi had a pile of cards and each card had a word on it. Now maybe you don't have anyone around to play 'hot seat' with but writing words on cards can still be useful. When I learnt Russian I got a pile of cards and I wrote a Russian word on one side of the card and the English translation on the other side. I put the cards in my coat pocket and everyday on the bus to work I read the cards to see how many I remembered. Every time I learnt a new word in my Russian class I made a card for it - so there were always new cards in my pocket. It really helped me remember new words - you should try it. And if you've got a friend to play 'hot seat' with - that's even better! OK. I want to have a quick look at something else. After every podcast I'll show you something that you can try to use in your own English - an expression or something like that. This week it was something that Carolina heard in the airport. Listen again to Carolina describing her bag to the man. Listen to the questions that the man asks. Look at these pictures. Which one looks most like your suitcase? Erm, this one, I think. The biggest one? Yes, I think so. And is it all black? The handle as well? Yes, everything. A black suitcase and a black handle. OK. Anything else? Yes. There was a label on it. With my name. And there's a little white star on the top, next to the handle. So I can see that it's mine. Little.. white star. OK. Anything else? No. I think that's everything. OK. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll find it. When Carolina described her bag the man said “Anything else?” Carolina said “No, that's everything”. 'Anything else' is something you hear quite a lot. You hear it in shops and restaurants - when you ask for something the shop assistant or waiter may say “Anything else?” to check if your order is finished. You can reply “That's everything” or, of course, you can ask for something else! Remember that we usually use anything in questions and negative sentences. That's why the question is 'Anything else?' Try to use 'Anything else?' before the next podcast! OK. I'm going to stop there. I'll talk to you all again next time. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcastATbritishcouncilDOT org. I'll be happy to answer them. In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. Right. That's all for this time. Bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello, and welcome to LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number three. My name's Ravi. And I'm Tess. I'm from London and Ravi's from Manchester and we're your presenters. And there's one more important person for you to meet - our producer, Gordon. Say hello to everyone Gordon! Hello! And how are you today Gordon? Very well Tess. And you? I'm fine! Good. We'll speak to Gordon again later in the show. You're very smart today Ravi. Is that a new shirt you're wearing? Yes - lovely isn't it. But you told me you're trying to save money. You said “no more new clothes”. Well, I know, but, well, you know me Tess. I saw it in the shop and I liked it, so I had a look at it, but they didn't have my size, so I thought oh well, never mind and then I looked again and they did have my size, so I thought, well I'll try it on but I won't buy it, and then I tried it on and of course it looked fantastic, and the shop assistant said it looked really good, and I still thought no, I won't buy it, and then I looked at the price, and it was quite expensive so I thought, no I can't buy it, and then the shop assistant said that it was in the sale - last week it was eighty pounds, but this week it was only forty pounds, that's half price so I bought it. Forty pounds!! For a shirt!! But look at it - it's a great shirt. We have to dress well now Tess - we're celebrities. This is a podcast Ravi! It isn't MTV! Nobody can see you. Ah - that's true, but I feel well-dressed, that's the important thing. Now let's move on to our 'I'd like to meet' section. In this part of the podcast we ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And we ask them to explain why. And today on 'I'd like to meet' we've got Martin with us. Hello Martin. Welcome to the podcast. Hello Ravi. Hello Tess. Hi Martin. And where are you from? I'm from Glasgow - the biggest city in Scotland. But Glasgow isn't the capital city, is it. No, Edinburgh's the capital city, but Glasgow's a lot bigger. And we call it the shopping capital of Scotland - we've got great shops in Glasgow. It's a great city. I'd like to visit sometime. I'm the king of shopping - ask Tess, she knows. It's true. Now it's time for the question. So Martin, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? I'd like to meet Jonathan Ive. Jonathan Ive? I don't know who he is. Not very many people know his name - he's English but he works for Apple, the computer company - he joined the company in 1992 - he's a vice president now I think - and he's the man who designed the iMac and the iPod. Wow. The man who invented the iPod! No, he didn't invent it - he's a designer, he designed it. He's designed other things too, of course, but the iMac and the iPod are my favourites - they're design classics. OK. And why did you choose Jonathan Ive. Jonathan Ive. Jonathan Ive to talk about today? Well, I'm a student and I study design - industrial design. And for anyone who studies industrial design, well, Jonathan Ive is the king, you know, he's a genius, he's the most important industrial designer in the world. The most important thing for industrial designers is function - you know - what something is used for, what it can do. And with computers speed was the most important thing. Nobody cared what they looked like, people just wanted them to be fast, really fast. But when Jonathan Ive designed the iMac for Apple, he designed something beautiful, and people loved it. It was still a good computer and very easy to use, but they also loved the way it looked - the round shape, the colours - and they all bought it, it was very, very popular. I got my first iMac in 1999 - it was orange, bright orange - it was beautiful - and I think that was the moment when I first decided to be a designer. And what about the iPod? Well, the iPod looks fantastic too. It's another example of perfect design. First, it's a fantastic idea - it changed the way that millions of people listen to music - even the Queen's got an iPod. And then, it's really easy to use, and finally, it's incredibly beautiful, it's beautiful to look at - that's what perfect design is. And that's why he's my hero. And is there a special question that you'd like to ask Jonathan Ive? I'd like to know why he doesn't want to be famous, why he doesn't like publicity. Perhaps he's shy - but he never talks about his personal life, he never goes to social events, you never see his picture in magazines. Everyone in the world knows the iMac and the iPod, but nobody knows the name Jonathan Ive. I suppose I'd like to ask him how he feels about that. Well, I've learnt something today. So have I. Thank you very much Martin. You're welcome. I'd like to know what the Queen listens to on her iPod! And don't forget, we'd like to hear from you, our listeners. Tell us which famous person, dead or alive, you'd like to meet - and why. Email us at 'learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org, that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - at - britishcouncil - all one word DOT org, that's o-r-g OK. Now it's quiz time. Every week we'll have a little quiz to make you think. This week it's another Ten Second Quiz. It's very easy - we give you a topic and you give as many answers as you can - in ten seconds. For example, if we say 'things that are blue' you can write down 'the sky' or 'the sea' - as many words as you can think of in ten seconds. Our two players today are Marina - hello Marina Hello. and Ricky. Hi Ricky. Hello. And could you tell us a little bit about yourselves? Erm, I'm Ricky, you know that - and I'm from Croydon, south of London, and I'm erm seventeen. And I'm Marina, I'm 16 and a half and I'm from Croydon too. We're at the same school. And now for the game. Do you both understand what to do? Yeah, OK. Let's start. You've got ten seconds to write down things that are yellow. OK? So, for example you could say 'banana'. OK? A banana is yellow. So 'things that are yellow'. Go! OK. Marina, how many have you got? Six. And how about you, Ricky? Only five. OK, so let's hear your six words, Marina. Things that are yellow. The sun, lemons, cheese the moon - sometimes, butter - and my hair. Your hair? Can we allow that Ravi? I think so. Her hair's blonde - I suppose that's yellow. Do you agree Gordon? Yes? OK, you're the winner Marina. Well done. Sorry Ricky. Actually, 'yellow things' is really difficult. Can you think of any more Ravi? Well, when Marina said 'butter' I thought of 'margarine' - but, yes a very difficult quiz. So - well done to both of you, but congratulations to Marina, our winner. Thanks Tess. Bye Bye. Thanks Marina and Ricky. And as usual, if any of you listening have a good game we can play in quiz time, write to us and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Don't forget - we'd love to hear your ideas for games we can play. What's next, Tess? The next part of the podcast is called 'Our person in'. Every week we listen to people in interesting places all over the world tell us something about life in the country they're in. Today it's Bob Harrison's turn. Bob lives in South Africa and he's going to tell us about a very unusual musical instrument. Bob is 'Our Man in South Africa'. If you're a football fan you'll know that the World Cup in 2010 will take place here in South Africa. When the famous names and the big stars walk out into the stadiums in 2010 they will hear a sound they've never heard before - the 'vuvuzela'. The 'vuvuzela' is almost a musical instrument - but not quite - and you hear it at every football match in South Africa. It's about a metre long and it sounds a bit like an angry elephant. When you hear a stadium full of fans blowing their 'vuvuzelas' the sound is something you'll never forget. Football is very popular in South Africa. The stadiums fill up early with fans - especially when the South African national team - called the 'Bafana Bafana' by their fans - are playing. The smell of food is everywhere - barbecued chicken or beef are very popular choices for football matches. And everywhere the sound of 'vuvuzelas'. Not everyone loves this strange music. Some fans say they've stopped going to matches because the noise is so awful and so, well, noisy. But as for me, well, I like it. I think it makes football matches in South Africa different from anywhere else in the world. The only thing is - I can't play the 'vuvuzela'! When I blow it doesn't sound like an angry elephant so much as a bored bee. I need to practise before 2010! So, it'll soon be World Cup time again Ravi. Are you looking forward to it? You're a football fan aren't you? Am I looking forward to it? I can't wait! And I'd love to go to South Africa to watch it. Those vuvuzelas sound amazing! And barbecued chicken! Hmm. You'd better start saving your money then. What money? I haven't got any. Exactly! But you like my shirt - admit it. Anyway, we'll hear from another one of our people in the next podcast. Or if you'd like to write in and tell us something interesting about your city or town, we'd love to hear from you. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Now it's time for 'Your turn'. In this part of the show, we go outside to find out what people think. And today we're going to stay on the subject of football. We've just heard about the World Cup in 2010, but how many people know about another World Cup in 2007? - the women's world cup. Do you watch women's football? Or maybe play it? Do you like it? Is it better than men's football? Why don't more people watch or play women's football? Why is men's football so much more popular than women's football? So here's the question for today 'Why don't more people watch women's football'? Good question Tess. 'Why don't more people watch women's football'? Let's listen to the answers. Well, I don't watch women's football because I don't like football, and that's that. All the football fans I know are men - so of course they like to watch men play. They'd only want to watch women if they were, you know, attractive - wearing little tight T-shirts and very small shorts - that's most men's attitude. I can't understand why women want to play football anyway, it's a ridiculous game - don't they have anything better to do with their time? I think it's just traditional in a lot of countries that football is a man's game. I used to play 'football' - we call it soccer - at home in the States actually. It's really big there - girls and boys play together at school. There are about 7 million women who play regularly in the States. I think it's because your football is quite new as a sport in the States so we don't really see it as a man's game - we don't have the same tradition. It's a game for everybody. I love watching women's football. I play at school, lots of girls do. My mum says I'm football crazy. I'm in the school team and I want to play professionally one day. Girls play better than boys - they don't lie down on the ground and cry and pretend they're hurt and they don't argue with the referee all the time. And they aren't violent, they don't try to hurt each other. People don't watch it because they don't know about it. Lots of girls and women play football nowadays - the problem is getting people to pay to watch it. We need to take women's football more seriously, we need advertising and companies to sponsor games and teams, we need a proper professional women's league with good pay and conditions, we need to see more games on television, then people might be more interested. People don't watch it because it isn't very good - it's as simple as that. I've watched some women's football, and to be honest, they don't play very well. They're slower than men - they aren't as good technically, the games are boring. Men's football is good to watch, women's isn't. Maybe that 'll change in the future, but at the moment, well, I certainly don't want to watch it. Interesting. What do you think Ravi? Well, to be honest, I've never watched a women's football game, but now I think I will - just to see what it's like. Me too. I agree. And what about you? Do you have an opinion about this question? We'd love to know what you think. 'Why don't more people watch women's football?' Or do you have an idea for a different question that we could ask on Your Turn. Send us an email at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org - and we can ask your question. OK. Now, it's time to meet Carolina again. Carolina is from Venezuela and she's visiting Britain for the first time. It's a big adventure for her - she's going to live, study and, she hopes, have a good time here in the UK - and we're going with her! In the last podcast we listened to a conversation that Carolina had at Heathrow airport in London. Do you remember what happened Tess? Yep - she lost her luggage. She was waiting at the Lost Luggage desk to see if they could find it. That's right. Let's listen to what happened next. Yes, that's right, from erm, Caracas, a blue bag. No, no it isn't blue, it's black. Oh, erm, sorry, black, not blue. He's looking for it now. Yeah yeah yeah, yeah that's the name. Yeah that's right. OK, thanks Ben. Have you found it? Is it my bag? Yes - this is your lucky day. One of the baggage handlers is bringing it up now, so you can identify it. Oh thank you so much. .. Erm, I have to get to King's Cross station to get the train to Newcastle at eight o'clock. How long does it take? Have I got enough time? By tube or train? Tube? I don't understand. The underground, you know, the metro. We call it the tube here. Yes, on the tube. You've got plenty of time. The tube takes about an hour - probably less at this time of the evening. Don't worry - it's very easy to find the station - just follow the signs. Here you are love - one black bag from Caracas. Yes, that's mine. Thank you. Could you sign your name here Excuse me. Could you tell me which train goes to King's Cross station please? Piccadilly line miss - the dark blue one on the map. Just follow the signs to the platform. You want an eastbound train - you're going east. And do I need to change trains? No, Heathrow and Kings Cross are both on the Piccadilly line. You don't need to change. Thank you Miss! You need to buy a ticket first! You can't go into the station without a ticket. Oh, OK. The ticket machines are over there. Oh, thank you - but I haven't got any English money yet - I didn't have time to change any in the airport. The machines take Visa or MasterCard. Oh good. I've got a Visa card. Thank you. Then you just put your ticket into the slot to go through the turnstile over there. Put your ticket in and you'll see a green light - then you can go through. And look after your ticket - don't lose it - you'll need to put it into the slot again when you leave the tube station at King's Cross. OK. Thank you for your help. So Carolina found her luggage in the end. Lucky girl. I lost a suitcase once and I had to wait ten days to get it back. You? No clothes for ten days? How did you live? I had to buy some new ones of course. Ha ha! So it wasn't a completely terrible experience then? No, not really. Are you ready for me? OK Gordon! Right, it's time for 'Gordon's joke'. What have you got for us today Gordon? A good one, as usual. Ha ha. Are you ready? Go ahead Gordon A man went into a pet shop one day. “I'd like a parrot that talks”, he said. The shop assistant said “I'm sorry sir, but you have to teach your parrot to speak.” So the man bought a parrot and took it home with him. A week later he went back to the pet shop. “My parrot still doesn't speak”, he said. “Oh, really? Well, perhaps he's bored. You should buy this little swimming pool. He can have a swim and then he might talk”, explained the shop assistant. So, he bought the swimming pool and went home. The next week the man came back again. “He's still not talking” he said. “Oh dear. Buy this mirror. He'll swim in the pool, get out and look at himself, then talk.” So the man bought the mirror and went away. A week later he came back a final time. “My parrot is dead”, he said. “Oh, dear! I'm very sorry about that, sir - but tell me, before he died, did he say anything?” “Yes he did. But only one thing.” “Really? What was that?” “Give me food!” Gordon! That's horrible! He didn't give it any food! Oh, poor parrot! And that's the end of this part of the show. We're going now, but please don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our English teacher on the podcast. After every show, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, stay with us, but I'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Bye! And don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org Hi, my name's Tom - you'll hear from me at the end of every podcast. I'm going to talk about some of the language that you heard in the podcast, and talk about ways to help you learn English. In the last podcast, we talked about using 'can you?' for a request - to ask someone to do something. Listen. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Lost Luggage Office is please? Today we listened to Carolina at the underground station asking someone to help her. Listen to what she said. Excuse me. Could you tell me which train goes to King's Cross station please? Piccadilly line miss. Carolina says 'could you?'. We use 'can you?' or 'could you?' when we're talking to friends or people that we know well. But we often use 'could you?' with people that we don't know very well, when we want to be very polite. Here's another example at the airport. Here you are love. One black bag from Caracas. Yes, that's mine. Thank you. Could you sign your name here The man at the lost luggage desk uses 'could you?' to Carolina because he is being polite. Listen to the pronunciation - 'could' 'could'. You spell it C-O-U-L-D, but the letter L is silent. 'Could'. Now listen to the words together. 'Could you' . The individual words are 'could' and 'you' but when we say them together we say 'could you'. We do this a lot in English. Here's another example. When we ask a question in the past we can use 'did you?' The individual words are 'did' and 'you' but together we say 'did you'. A good learner's dictionary will tell you how to pronounce individual words like 'could' - it uses special symbols. But it doesn't tell you how words sound when we put them together. It's a good idea to make a note of the pronunciation of common phrases like 'could you?' or 'did you?'. You can use words and sounds from your own language. This will help you to remember how to say them. There's another thing I noticed in the same dialogue. Listen to it again, and notice what the man says when he gives Carolina her bag. Here you are love. One black bag from Caracas. Yes, that's mine. Thank you. Could you sign your name here He called her 'love'. Do you remember the old lady at the airport who called Carolina 'dear'? 'Love' is very similar. Older people might call you 'love' sometimes, even if they don't know you. They're just being friendly, so don't think it's strange. Now, let's talk about something different - the verb 'look'. Listen to Ravi and Tess. Forty pounds!! For a shirt!! But look at it - it's a great shirt. Ravi is using 'look' in the usual way. He wants Tess to look at his shirt carefully to see how nice it is. Now listen to 'look' in this section about Carolina's lost bag. Oh, erm, sorry, black, not blue. He's looking for it now. The man used 'look for'. He isn't looking at Carolina's bag - he doesn't know where it is - he's trying to find it. That's what 'look for' means - to try to find something. The meaning of 'look' changes because of 'for'. Now listen to another section - about Carolina's ticket. How is 'look' used here? And look after your ticket - don't lose it - you'll need to put it into the slot again when you leave the tube station at King's Cross. The man tells Carolina to 'look after' her ticket. He means 'take care of it', 'don't lose it'. The meaning of 'look' changes because of 'after'. So, 'look at', 'look for' and 'look after', all have different meanings. There are lots and lots of verbs like this in English - verbs that change their meanings. 'Look' is just one example. Some people call them 'phrasal verbs' and some people call them 'multi-word verbs'. In the first podcast I talked about keeping a vocabulary notebook. Use your notebook to make a note of any multi-word verbs that you notice. You can usually understand their meaning in a sentence, or you can use a learner's dictionary. For example, you can keep a page of your vocabulary book just for 'look' and make new pages for other verbs when you come across them. There you are! Another example! 'Come across' means 'to find something accidentally' - when you aren't trying to find it. So now you can start another page for 'come'. Now for something different. Do you remember the name of the strange musical instrument that they play at football matches in South Africa? Listen. When the famous names and the big stars walk out into the stadiums in 2010 they will hear a sound they've never heard before - the 'vuvuzela'. The 'vuvuzela' is almost a musical instrument - but not quite - and you hear it at every football match in South Africa. Yes, it's the vuvuzela. But I'm not really interested in the name. I want you to notice that he says 'the vuvuzela'. In English we use 'the' with the names of musical instruments. So we say 'I can play the 'piano' or 'can you play the guitar'? This may be different in your language, so try to remember it. That's nearly the end. Just one more thing before I go. Here's a phrase that I'd like you to try and use this week. It's another multi-word verb with 'look', so you can add it to your 'look' page in your vocabulary notebook. Listen to Ravi and Tess talking about the 2010 World Cup. So, it'll soon be World Cup time again Ravi. Are you looking forward to it? You're a football fan aren't you? Am I looking forward to it? I can't wait! Ravi is looking forward to the World Cup. He's excited about it. He loves football and he's going to really enjoy watching it. Can you translate 'look forward to' into your language? Try to use it this week. If someone says to you 'Are you coming to the party on Saturday' you can say 'Yes, I'm really looking forward to it'. OK. That's all from me. I'll talk to you all again next time - I'm looking forward to it. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello again and welcome to LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number four. I'm Ravi - from Manchester And I'm Tess - from London. Hi. Now, as usual we've got loads of great stuff for you to listen to but before we tell you about that - Ravi, I have to ask you, are you feeling better now? Oh, a lot better now thank you. On Saturday morning Ravi called me and he sounded terrible. “Oh Tess, I feel really bad.” Yeah, OK. I did feel terrible. I had a really bad cold, a headache, ugh! I had a football match on Saturday afternoon too. You didn't play football, did you? No, I felt too bad. Do you know what I did? What? A friend came over and we watched all of the Lord of the Rings films - all three of them. Ten hours of DVDs! You're joking. I can't watch TV for that long. I get bored. Anyway, I didn't really like Lord of the Rings. I liked the book. The film's never as good as the book, I think. I haven't read the book so I don't know but, believe it or not, that's exactly the question we asked people in 'Your Turn' this week - 'Which do you prefer - the book or the film?' Really? I bet everyone says that books are better. I'm not so sure. Anyway, that's for later. Now it's time for 'I'd like to meet'. In this part of the podcast we ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And we ask them to explain why. So let's say hello to this week's guest, Marcus, from London. Welcome to 'I'd like to meet' Marcus. Thank you Ravi. Hello Marcus. Hi Tess. And you're from London Marcus. That's where I'm from. That's right. I was born here - and I've lived here all my life. And what do you do? I work in a supermarket, but I want to be a professional musician - that's my ambition for the future. We all need ambitions Marcus - and that's a good one. Now I'm going to ask the question. So Marcus, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? I think I can guess - you're going to talk about a musician aren't you? You're right Tess. Hmm. She's always right! I'd like to meet Bob Marley. Bob Marley! He's one of my heroes. I'm sure all our listeners know Bob Marley, but could you explain who he is for us? Bob Marley was Jamaican - and he was the man who gave reggae music to the world - the world outside Jamaica of course. And the Rastafarian religion too - he was also famous for his religious beliefs. He was born in 1945 and died in 1981. So, he died very young - he was only in his thirties. Hmm. How did he die? He had cancer. And why did you choose him to talk about today? Bob Marley never wrote a bad song. My father was a big Bob Marley fan so I grew up listening to his music at home when I was a kid - I used to listen to it when I was sad - it's impossible to listen to Bob Marley and feel unhappy - that was his message to the world -“'Don't worry, be happy”. He wasn't interested in negative things - his music was always positive. He's a legend. He was the first 'superstar' from a poor country - and that's why people from poor countries all over the world love him so much - his music speaks to them. Everywhere you go, everywhere in the world, people know and love Bob Marley - everywhere. He was poor, he grew up in an area called Trench Town - a very poor area in Jamaica, with gang problems and drug problems. He left school when he was fourteen and started work. His message is universal - it's a protest really. It's about how human beings are all the same, black or white, rich or poor, and his religion helped him to understand that. He once said “I don't stand for the black man's side, I don't stand for the white man's side - I stand for God's side”. God was very important to him - he was a very spiritual man. I'm a musician and I want my music to have a message - I want to make people feel good. Like in the song “One love, one heart, let's get together and feel all right” - that's the message - it's so simple. And is there a special question that you'd like to ask him Marcus? Thousands! But no, not really, not one special question. I'd like to sit and talk to him for a long time - all night if I could - but no, not one special question. I enjoyed that Marcus. Thanks a lot. Me too. Thank you. Thank you And remember listeners, that we'd like to hear from you. Which famous person, dead or alive, would you like to meet? And why? Email us at 'learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org - that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - AT- britishcouncil - all one word - DOT org, that's o-r-g. Let us know which famous person you would like to meet. Oh, I feel like listening to some Bob Marley now. No time for that Tess, it's time for our quiz. Every week we have a little quiz to make you think. This week we're going to play Hot Seat again. Here to play are Hannah and Max. Hi Hannah. Hello Hi Max Hello. You're both from Sheffield, is that right? And how old are you? I'm seventeen And I'm sixteen. We go to the same school. St Joseph's. Are you in the same class? We are, yeah. OK. And who's doing what? Who's going to explain the words and who's going to be in the Hot Seat? I'll explain and Max'll guess. OK. OK, Max? OK. Right. Remember how to play? These cards have all got words on. Hannah has to explain the words and Max has to guess them. But remember Hannah, you can't use the words on the card. Max, you have to guess as many words as you can in one minute. OK? Then let's go. You've got one minute starting now! Erm.. big thing. On the sea. You sail in it. Boat? Ship. Ship! An animal. Small. Big ears. Elephant. No. It's small. Carrots! It eats carrots. Rabbit. Yes, yes! Erm.. you do it at the disco. Dance. Yes! It's a fruit I think. It's very hard. It's got milk inside.

Is that right? Yes, nine. Brilliant. Well done Hannah and Max! Well done! And if any of you listening have a good game we can play in quiz time, write to us and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. We'd love to hear your ideas for games we can play. Phew! It makes me tired just listening to Hot Seat so now we'll have something a bit more relaxed. It's time for 'Our Person In'. This is the part of the podcast where we listen to people in interesting places all over the world telling us something about life in the country they're in. This week Robert Watson is Our Man in Hong Kong. In the centre of Hong Kong everything is new, modern and busy. It's difficult to think what the city was like a hundred years ago. But only forty-five minutes away from the centre, on the small island of Cheung Chau we can see another side of Hong Kong - a side that is not very different from how it was centuries ago. Every year, in May, Cheung Chau celebrates its Bun Festival. The buns are small, white, bread rolls and huge towers made of bamboo are covered in the sweet buns in the festival, which lasts for a week. No-one knows exactly why the festival started but there is a procession to honour Pak Tai - the sea god. In this procession, children in fantastic costumes are carried through the village. The costumes hide the seats that the children are sitting on and it looks like they are flying. For three days before the festival no-one on the island eats meat. The butcher's shop is closed and restaurants serve only vegetarian dishes. Even the small McDonald's on the island sells only vegetarian food for these three days. Perhaps, for three days, this quiet corner of one of the busiest places on earth is the only place where you can't buy a Big Mac at McDonald's! No Big Macs. Sounds great. Oh come on Tess, everybody eats a Big Mac now and then. I don't. Ugh! You never eat fast food? I try not to. Horrible stuff! Actually, fast food might be a good idea for Your Turn - but not this week. Your Turn, listeners, is when we go into the street Oh, you forgot to give the address. Oh right. Yes. Sorry. If you'd like to write in and tell us something interesting about your city or town, we'd love to hear from you. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. OK. Now we can move on to Your Turn. We went out into the street to find out what people think about this question: “Which do you prefer - the book or the film?” Book or film? For me, the book, but let's hear what people said. I definitely prefer the book. I love going to the cinema but if there's a book and I've read it, then I never go to see the film. Reading books is all about imagination and the film spoils that. Like when you read a book and you can't imagine the character because you keep thinking of, say, Brad Pitt's face. The film definitely. Look at Lord of the Rings. It's a really long book. In fact it's three long books - it takes months to read and with the film you get all the special effects and it looks fantastic - much more exciting than the books. It depends. It depends on the book. If it's a serious book by a good writer then the book is always better than the film but if it's not a great book - a thriller or something like that - the film can be better than the book. Uh, the book, for me. You have to work harder with a book - you have to make the pictures in your head but when it's a good writer it's like watching a film - you make the book into your own film, in your head, and everyone has a different film - that's much better! I think I prefer films. You get more from a film. In a book you only get the story and you have to imagine how things look. In a film you get the story and you get the actors and music and everything. For example, if a film is set in Japan you get to see Japan. I've never been to Japan - I can't imagine it! A film shows you more. Well, I disagree with him but there were some interesting opinions there. Remember that we'd love to know what you think. 'Which do you prefer - the book or the film?' Or do you have an idea for a question that we could ask on Your Turn? Send us an email at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org and we can ask your question in another podcast. Now it's time to meet Carolina again. As you probably remember, Carolina is a Venezuelan student and she's visiting Britain for the first time. She's going to Newcastle, in the north east of England. She's going to live and study there, and of course, have a lot of fun - we hope! In the last podcast we listened to Carolina's conversation at the underground station. She was going to King's Cross station to get the train to Newcastle. That's right. And she was worried that she didn't have time to get to the station to catch her train. But everything was all right. Carolina caught her train - with only a few minutes to spare. So let's listen now to what happened on the train to Newcastle. Excuse me, is anyone sitting here? No, it's free. Sorry, I'll move my bag. situated towards the front of the train. We would like to remind passengers that coach F, at the rear of the train, is the Quiet Coach. If you are sitting in coach F, please use all electronic equipment quietly and switch mobile phones to silent mode. Please be considerate to other passengers. Thank you. Coach F? Yeah, this is a Quiet Coach. There's a sign - look. No mobile phone conversations. No noise. It's cool. I hate listening to other people's conversations. Oh, OK. I didn't know. It's a good idea. Yeah. Where are you going? Newcastle. Me too. Do you live there? No, I'm going to study there - at the university. What about you? Do you live there? Yeah. I'm at the university too. It's a great city. You aren't English are you. No, I'm Venezuelan. Cool. You speak really good English. Thank you. My mother's English, but I've never been to Britain before. It's all a bit strange. Hello? Dan? Yes, hi, how's it going? Yes, I'm on the train. Yeah? Yeah it finished at six o'clock more or less. Excuse me! This is a quiet coach. Could you have your conversation in the corridor? What? Uh? Yeah, OK, sorry. Yeah, Dan, sorry, what did you say? I didn't hear you, I'm in the quiet coach - some woman was complaining about I'm going to get a coffee or something. D'you want anything? Erm, I don't know, what have they got? Come with me then, you can have a look. They've got sandwiches and stuff too. OK. There you go - there's the list on the wall. What d'you fancy? Fancy? What do you mean? Sorry. What would you like. What do you fancy means what would you like. Do you think I can pay with my visa card? I still haven't got any English money - I lost my bag, and then I nearly missed the train Don't worry about it. This one's on me. I'll pay. Have a toasted sandwich - they're good. Cheese and tomato? Cheese with tomato? In a toasted sandwich? Delicious! Oh no! What about cheese and ham then? Yes, cheese and ham please And to drink? Coke? Orange juice? A beer? Erm, orange juice please. Can I help you? Yes, erm two toasted sandwiches please - one cheese and tomato, one cheese and ham - an orange juice and a coke. How much is that? Two toasted sandwiches, three forty-five each, coke ninety p, orange juice one pound forty, that's nine pounds twenty please. Here you are. And that's eighty p change. Thank you. That's very kind of you. It's a lot of money. That's nearly ten pounds. Don't worry about it. I'm a real gentleman. Tell you what, you can take me out for lunch one day in Newcastle. You can pay for me. I'll give you my phone number. Is that a deal? OK. It's a deal. Good. Now let's sit down and eat these. OK Hmm. Jamie sounds nice. Uh, honestly, you women! What?! Never mind. Right, that's almost the end but we can't go before we hear from Gordon, our producer. Hey, Gordon, I've got a joke for you this week. Oh yes? Erm, come on then, let's hear it. OK. What's red and invisible? Erm, I don't know. What's red and invisible? No tomatoes! Ho, ho, ho! That's worse than mine. Leave the jokes to me Ravi. Come on then, let's hear it for this week. Right. I've got the perfect joke for this week's podcast. Ready? OK. OK then. A man goes into a cinema to watch a film. He sits down and in front of him there's a man and a dog. You can't take dogs into a cinema, can you? You can in this cinema. Anyway, the film's a romantic comedy. After a little while there's a funny part in the film, and - amazing - the dog starts laughing at the film. Uh-huh. Yeah. A little while after that there's a very sad scene. The dog starts crying its eyes out. This goes on for the whole film - the dog laughs at the funny parts and cries at the sad parts. Well, at the end of the film, the man waits outside the cinema until the man with the dog comes out. “Excuse me” he says, “I watched your dog crying and laughing all through the film. It's absolutely amazing”. “I know” says the man with the dog. “It is amazing. He hated the book”. Are all your jokes about funny animals Gordon? Ah well, most of them, yes. OK. We have to go now but don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our English teacher. After every show, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, don't go away, but we'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Tess Bye! Don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Hi, my name's Tom - you'll hear from me at the end of every podcast. I'm going to talk about some of the language that you heard, and talk about ways to help you learn English. The first thing I want to talk about today is British money. British money is 'pounds' and 'pence'. One pound is one hundred pence - there are a hundred pence in a pound. Listen to Carolina and Jamie buying food on the train. Listen to how much everything costs. Can I help you? Yes, erm two toasted sandwiches please - one cheese and tomato, one cheese and ham - an orange juice and a coke. How much is that? Two toasted sandwiches, three forty-five each, coke ninety p, orange juice one pound forty, that's nine pounds twenty please. Did you notice that she didn't say 'three pounds and forty-five pence'? She said 'three forty-five'. British people often say prices like this. Sometimes they say 'pounds' and sometimes they don't. The woman said 'nine pounds twenty' for the total. You will hear people say prices in both ways. But - it's important to remember that if the price is only pounds - when there are no pence in the price, then we always say 'pounds'. For example, we can say 'three pounds forty-five', or 'three forty-five' - but we must always say 'three pounds'. Now let's think about the pence. Listen again to the prices. Two toasted sandwiches, three forty-five each, coke ninety p, orange juice one pound forty, that's nine pounds twenty please. Did you notice that she didn't say 'pence'? British people don't usually say 'pence'. If the price has pounds first, then we understand that the second number is pence. We don't need to say anything, just the number. But Jamie's coke was 'ninety p'. If the price is only pence, then we say p. It's a short way of saying pence. 'p' means pence. I'd like to say something else about Carolina and Jamie's conversation. Jamie uses a lot of phrases that are probably new for you. They are phrases that you don't often read in coursebooks or learn in classes. But they're phrases that British people use a lot. Here's an example. There you go - there's the list on the wall. What d'you fancy? Fancy? What do you mean? Sorry. What would you like. What do you fancy means what would you like. 'What do you fancy?' is very informal. Carolina doesn't understand so she asks Jamie. She says “What do you mean?”. Then Jamie explains that 'What do you fancy' means 'What would you like?' Here's another example, from Jamie again. Listen for a phrase that's new for you. Do you think I can pay with my visa card? I still haven't got any English money - I lost my bag, and then I nearly missed the train Don't worry about it. This one's on me. I'll pay. Have a toasted sandwich - they're good. Cheese and tomato? Cheese with tomato? In a toasted sandwich? Jamie says 'This one's on me', which is an informal way of saying 'It's OK, I'm going to pay for this'. Try to remember phrases like this when you notice them. And do what Carolina did - ask 'What do you mean?' if you don't understand. Now, I've got an interesting word to talk about next. The word is 'stuff'. Listen to Tess speaking and see if you can understand what 'stuff' means. And I'm Tess - from London. Hi. Now, as usual we've got loads of great stuff for you to listen to but before we tell you about that; Ravi, I have to ask you, are you feeling better now? 'Stuff' just means 'things'. British people use it a lot when they're speaking. Here's another example. I'm going to get a coffee or something. D'you want anything? Erm, I don't know, what have they got? Come with me then, you can have a look. They've got sandwiches and stuff too. OK. Jamie doesn't want to tell Carolina all of the things that she can buy, so he just says 'sandwiches and stuff' - all the other things that they can buy to eat on the train. The next time you listen to a film or a TV programme in English, listen for people saying 'stuff'. I'm sure you'll notice it a lot now. It's nearly time for me to go, but first, I want to give you a phrase for you to try and use this week. Do you remember the question in today's 'Your Turn'? It was 'Which do you prefer - the book or the film?' Listen to one of the answers. It depends. It depends on the book. If it's a serious book by a good writer then the book is always better than the film but if it's not a great book - a thriller or something like that - the film can be better than the book He says 'It depends'. We talked about 'it depends' in the first podcast. This time 'it depends' means 'I'm not sure because sometimes I have one opinion and sometimes I have a different opinion.' Let's look at how to use it in a sentence. The man says 'it depends on the book'. Notice the preposition. We say 'it depends on something'. So if someone asks you a question, like 'Do you like dogs?' you can say 'Well, it depends on the dog - I like small dogs, but I don't like big ones'. Try to use it this week. OK. That's all from me today. I'll talk to you all again on the next podcast. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello again and welcome to LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number five. I'm Ravi - from Manchester And I'm Tess - from London. We're here with Gordon - our producer. Hello Gordon. Hello!  . and, as usual, we've got lots of interesting things for you to listen to. But first of all, do you want to know my big news for this week, Ravi? Let me guess. You're going to be the star of a brand new Hollywood movie? You've won the lottery? Not quite, Ravi. I've got a cat! Really? Well, it's just a baby cat - a kitten, but yes, I got him yesterday. He's gorgeous. It's a boy cat then? Where did you get him? Tess: Well, my friend Kate found him in the street. And Kate's already got two cats so I said I'd take this one. What colour is he? Well, he's only small but he's a brown tabby. What's a tabby again? Is that the stripy one? That's it - tabbies are the ones with sort of dark stripes - like a tiger. He's really lovely. What are you going to call him? D'you know, I just don't know. I've got lots of ideas for names but I can't decide. I thought maybe you could help me. What would you call a cat? Hmm. That's a difficult question. To be honest, Tess, I'm more of a dog person. I've never really thought about names for cats. You don't like cats? Well, it's not that I don't like cats. I just prefer dogs, that's all. Anyway, I've got an idea, why don't you call your cat 'Gordon'. Hmm. I don't think so. I need to think of a name soon though, really. Anyway, let's move on. Let's start with I'd Like to Meet. If you're listening for the first time, I'd Like to Meet is the part of the show where someone tells us about the famous person - alive or dead - that they'd like to meet - and why. This time round we've got Olu with us. Hi Olu. Hi Tess. Where are you calling from Olu? From West London. And what do you do? I'm still at school. In Year 12 Tess: OK. And who would you like to meet, Olu? Who are you going to talk to us about? I'd like to meet Didier Drogba. Drogba? The footballer? Chelsea? You do know I'm from Manchester, don't you, Olu? You know, Manchester United? Yeah, well, it's not just because he's Chelsea. Come on Olu - don't listen to him. Why would you like to meet Didier Drogba? Tell us something about him. Well, he's a footballer - you already know that - and he's from Ivory Coast, in West Africa, and he plays great football. And do you like him because he's a good footballer? Well, I do, I like the way he plays and he scores some great goals and all that, but there's more than that. He was born in Ivory Coast but he moved to France when he was five - he went on his own to live with his uncle. Imagine that - a five year-old boy moving to a new country by himself? Wow. And then he went back to Ivory Coast but moved back to France a bit after that. His family were really poor, you know, and they had to move around to look for work and that. So did he start playing football in Ivory Coast? No - in France. And this is another thing I like about him, see, most players at the really big clubs go there when they're quite young but Drogba played for a few years with small teams and worked his way up, through hard work. He was 26, I think, when he went to Chelsea. But anyway, what I like him for most is that even though he's made it now and he's got loads of money and that he really hasn't forgotten where he came from. He does loads of work for Unicef - he's like an ambassador or something for them so he does all this charity work. Y'see, my dad came here from Nigeria when he was really small and, I've never been to Africa but all you see on TV is about problems in Africa all the time so it's really good to see someone who comes from somewhere like Ivory Coast doing good things, you know. And Ivory Coast were in the World Cup in Germany, weren't they? Yeah. It's the first time they've got to the World Cup Finals, and they did OK. Drogba was African footballer of the year as well. And what would you like to say to Didier Drogba if you met him, Olu? Erm, I guess I'd say thank you to him for the work he does for Africa and for showing people something good from Africa. And for scoring all those goals for Chelsea! Hmmm. I don't know about that. But that was great Olu, thank you. And don't forget, we'd like to hear from you, our listeners. Tell us which famous person, dead or alive, you'd like to meet - and why. Email us at 'learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org., that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - at - britishcouncil - all one word dot org, that's o-r-g. I'll tell you what Tess, why don't you call your cat Didier? That's a great name for a cat. Hmm. I don't think so, really. OK. Now it's quiz time. What is it this time Ravi? It's something a bit different today - we've got our two players joining us on the telephone - I hope - Hello Vineeta? Hi Ravi And hello Jason. Hello Jason - where are you from and how old are you? Erm.. I'm 15 and I'm from Durham. Near Newcastle? That's where Carolina is. What's the weather like in Durham today Jason? Not great, really. It's a bit cloudy. Oh dear. How are things where you are Vineeta? Where are you? I'm in Plymouth. OK Plymouth - we've got opposite ends of the country here, Durham and Plymouth. It's north against south. Sorry, Vineeta, what's the weather like in Plymouth? Not too bad. Quite sunny. OK. Better than Durham. Right. Do you both know what you have to do? I'll explain for our listeners. I'm going to ask Jason and Vineeta some questions. To answer, they press any button on their phone and we'll hear a buzzer. Let's hear yours Jason. And yours Vineeta Great. Now, the quiz is called 'Beginning With..' - your answer has to begin with the letter I give you - so if I say, for example, 'a sport beginning with 'F' you could say 'football'. Let's have a practice run to begin with. Fingers ready? An animal beginning with P Jason? Polar bear Yes. OK then, let's play. First one to three is the winner. Ready? OK then, let's go. A vegetable beginning with 'L' Jason! Lettuce Right. One nil to Jason. A colour beginning with 'Y'. Jason again. Yellow Right. Two nil. Come on Vineeta. A bird beginning with 'E'. Vineeta. Eagle. Yes. Well done Vineeta. Two one. OK. A sport beginning with 'G' Jason. Golf Yes! That's three for Jason so you're the winner. Well done Jason. And bad luck Vineeta. He was just a bit quicker than you. Yeah. But never mind. Well done to both of you and thank you both for playing. Now, Tess, a cat's name beginning with.. I wish I could decide. Remember listeners that if you've got any ideas for games we can play, we'd love to hear them. You can send them to the usual address.. Right, now then. The next part of our podcast is Our Person In - the part of the show where we hear from different people around the world. You'll like it this time Ravi - you like Lord of the Rings. Graham Baxter is Our Man in New Zealand. When I was a boy and I first read Lord of the Rings, I dreamt of visiting the places Tolkien, the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, created. Hobbiton, Middle Earth, Mount Doom. Now, finally, I have found all of these places, here, in New Zealand. Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings films, was born in Wellington - the capital city of New Zealand. When he was looking for places to make the fantastic worlds he needed for his films he knew where to look. New Zealand has all kinds of scenery - and you can see a lot of it in the three films. The green hills of Matamata became Hobbiton and the Queenstown area became the Eregion Hills - and lots of other places - all with a little bit of help from computer magic. People in New Zealand are proud of their country's star role in the films but they are also happy at what Lord of the Rings has done to bring tourists to New Zealand. After the third film in the trilogy, The Return of the King, won 11 Oscars the number of tourists who visited New Zealand went up by 8%. More than a billion people have visited the Lord of the Rings website - fantastic publicity for this small country. For me, this is my boyhood dream come true - a tour of the amazing worlds of Lord of the Rings - and all right here in New Zealand. Great. I'd love to go to New Zealand. I've always wanted to go. Me too. The scenery sounds amazing. And it always looks so green in pictures. Yeah. It looks fantastic. Don't forget listeners that we'd love to hear about the scenery or countryside in your country. Is there a special place you like to go or some especially famous countryside? You can write and tell us about it. As usual the address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Go on, why not write, we're always happy to hear from our listeners? Now, for Your Turn this time, since I've got a new cat, we decided to ask people a very important question - “Which do you prefer - cats or dogs?” It's a very simple question but people have very strong opinions. Let's hear what they said. Dogs. Definitely. Why? Look - if you've got a dog it really loves you. All cats care about is who feeds them. You can think a cat loves you but if someone else gives it food it'll be gone. Well, I've got two cats so I think you know what my answer will be. But cats are just so much easier to look after. With dogs you've got to take them for walks all the time and all of that and you have to clean up their poo - yeuch. That's easy. Dogs are noisy, smelly and stupid; cats are much more intelligent. If you're sitting on your sofa, right, it's lovely when a cat comes and sits on you and purrs. Would you want a big daft dog to come and sit on you? Cats are just so boring. All they do is sit around and sleep all day. They're selfish, basically. Dogs play with you and stuff. They're fun, you know. Well, to be honest, I'm not really an animal lover. I think it's cruel to keep dogs in the city - they should be in the country. Cats make me sneeze and they're a real problem if you want to go on holiday. If I had to have a pet I'd probably have a goldfish. Interesting. What about you Tess? Why do you prefer cats? I just do. Cats are so much more intelligent than dogs, I think. I like dogs too but, you know, like the last person said, I think it's a bit cruel to keep a dog in a small flat like mine. OK. What about you listeners? Cats or dogs - which do you prefer? You can write and let us know. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. We'd love to hear from you. Right. Now it's time to meet Carolina again. Carolina is from Venezuela and she's come to the UK to live and study - and have fun! Last time we listened Carolina was on the train from London to Newcastle in the north of England, where she's going to study at university. Let's see what happened when she arrived in Newcastle. Another student is showing her round the student accommodation.  ... and if you get lost just ask someone. Anyway, this is the kitchen. Like I said, there are five of you in this flat and this is the kitchen for your flat. The other flats have all got their own kitchens. Right - I think that's everything, I'm going to get back. I'm sure you want some time to unpack your stuff. Some of the other girls in your flat are here already. You'll probably meet them here in the kitchen a bit later. OK. Thanks Gemma. Thanks for showing me around. No problem. I'll probably see you around. OK. See you. I'm sure you'll have a great time in Newcastle. Thanks. Bye Erm. Hello. Charlotte: Hi. Oh! Are you in Room 4? Hi! Come in! Hi. Yes, I'm in Room 4. I'm Carolina. Hi Carolina. I'm Charlotte. Nice to meet you. I'm in Room 2. We're neighbours. Oh, right. Nice to meet you. I'm Emily. I'm in number 1. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And I'm Jenny. Hi. Hi Jenny. Do you all know each other? No - we just met this afternoon. There's another girl, Beth, but she's not here at the moment. Have you just arrived? I'm sorry - I didn't catch your name. Carolina. Yes, erm, I arrived about an hour ago. Did you fly to Newcastle? No, erm, I got the train to Newcastle. I flew to London - to Heathrow. Ah, OK. Where are you from? I'm from Venezuela. Really? Wow! Have you flown from Venezuela today? You must be exhausted. Yes. I am actually. I just wanted to meet you all before I went to bed. What's the time difference between here and Venezuela? It's four hours behind here. So it's seven o'clock in the evening in Venezuela now. Do you want a cup of tea Carolina? Erm. .. No thanks. I'm going to go to bed. Erm. Do any of you know where we have to go to register tomorrow? I do. I went there today. I can go with you if you want? Really? That would be great. Can I come too? I need to register as well. What course are you doing Carolina? Erm Environmental Science. How about you? French and Politics. I think we have to register in the same place. You do. It's all in the same building. Shall we go at about nine tomorrow morning? Is that too early for you Carolina? No. Nine o'clock is OK. If that's OK with you, sorry, erm Jenny? Jenny: Nine's fine. It's a date! Now, you get yourself to bed Carolina - you look exhausted. OK. I am. Nice to meet you all. See you in the morning. Goodnight/See you tomorrow/See you in the morning. Right. Carolina seems to be OK in Newcastle. Her flatmates sound nice. Yeah. How does it work? She doesn't share a room with anyone, does she? I don't think so. I didn't. Usually a 'flat' has four or five rooms - single rooms - and then those four or five people have a shared kitchen and maybe a shared bathroom too. Oh, OK. I see. Anyway, we'll hear more about Carolina next time. Now it's time for da-dah! Gordon and his amazing jokes. So what have you got for us today Gordon? Parrots? Talking dogs? Chickens. They can't talk though. OK. Come on then. Let's hear it. OK. A man is driving slowly down a country road when he sees a chicken run in front of his car. Nothing strange about that - but then, he notices that the chicken has three legs. \"How strange\" he thinks, \"a three-legged chicken\". He starts to drive a bit faster - 40 kilometres an hour - but the chicken goes faster too. He drives a bit faster - 70 kilometres an hour - but the three-legged chicken just runs faster too. The man goes faster and faster but the chicken keeps running. When they are both doing over one hundred kilometres an hour, the chicken turns a corner into a farm. Quickly, the man stops his car. The farmyard is full of three-legged chickens. There are three-legged chickens everywhere. So, he sees the farmer in the farmyard and he asks him, “Where do all of these three-legged chickens come from? This is amazing”. “I breed them” says the farmer. “There are three of us, me, my wife and our son. We all like chicken legs, so I made a three-legged chicken, so we can all have a leg at dinner time”. “Amazing” says the man, “How's the meat? Does it taste good?” “Well”, says the farmer, “I don't know. We haven't caught one of them yet.” I don't get it. Oh, Tess. They can't catch the chickens because they're so fast. So do they taste good or not? Never mind Tess, never mind. Right. That's all we've got time for this time but don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our English teacher. After every show, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, don't go away, but I'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Bye! Don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Hi, my name's Tom - you'll hear from me at the end of every podcast. I'm going to talk about some of the language that you heard, and talk about ways to help you learn English. Today I want to talk about verbs. You probably know that most verbs in English are 'regular'. That means that the forms are very easy to remember. For all regular verbs, we make the past form in the same way. We add 'E, D' . For example, the verb 'look'. The verb is 'look' and to make the past form we just add 'E,D'. 'Looked'. And the verb 'like'. It already ends in 'E' so we just add 'D' to make the past. 'Liked'. So far so good. But the bad news is that a lot of the most common English verbs, verbs that you need to use all the time, are 'irregular'. This means that they don't follow the same rule. 'Have' is an irregular verb. You already know that the past of 'have' isn't 'haved' - it's 'had'. But there are a lot more of them. Listen to part of Carolina's conversation with her new flatmates. Can you hear the three different forms of the verb 'fly'? Did you fly to Newcastle? No, erm, I got the train to Newcastle. I flew to London - to Heathrow. Ah, OK. Where are you from? I'm from Venezuela. Really? Wow! Have you flown from Venezuela today? You must be exhausted. Did you hear the three forms? They were 'fly', 'flew' and 'flown'. If you use a coursebook, or have a grammar book to study, it probably has a list of irregular verbs. And the list is organised in three columns. If you look for the verb 'fly' you will see 'fly' in the first column, 'flew' in the second column and 'flown' in the third. Listen again. Did you fly to Newcastle? No, erm, I got the train to Newcastle. I flew to London - to Heathrow. 'Fly' is the base form of the verb - some people call it the infinitive. We use it in lots of different ways. For example - we use it with 'going to' to talk about the future. 'He's going to fly to London next week'. We use it with 'do' and 'did' to make questions, 'Did you fly to Newcastle?' Remember that this first column is not the present tense. It might look the same - we say 'I fly to London every week', but remember that we say 'he or she flies'. The second column is 'flew'. This column is easy - it's the past simple form. 'Flew' is the past simple of fly. Carolina flew to London and then she got the train to Newcastle. Now let's look at the third column. Listen again. I'm from Venezuela. Really? Wow! Have you flown from Venezuela today? You must be exhausted. The third column is 'flown'. Some people call it 'the past participle'. We never use this form alone - we use it with other verbs. We often use it with 'have' or 'has' to make the present perfect, like Emily did - 'Have you flown from Venezuela today?'. Or we can say 'I've never flown in a helicopter'. We also use the third column with the verb 'be' in sentences like 'Nissan cars are made in Japan' or 'My bag was stolen on the bus'. So, that's the three columns in an irregular verb list. Now we need to think about the best way to learn these irregular forms. It probably isn't a very good idea to sit down with a list of irregular verbs and try to learn all of them. There are a lot of irregular verbs in English, and some of them will be verbs that are new to you. The important thing is to learn the three forms of the verbs that you already know, so that you can use those verbs correctly. Make a page in your notebook for irregular verbs - make three columns and fill in the verbs that you already know. Verbs like 'make', 'do', 'meet', 'have' and 'go' for example. Then write a sentence with each form as an example. Example sentences will help you to remember the forms. Then when you find a new verb you can add it to your list. You can find a link to a list of irregular verbs on our website - use it to check the forms of the verbs that you know and add them to your notebook. Now let's talk about something different. The weather. Listen to Ravi talking to the people who are going to do the quiz. What's the weather like in Durham today Jason? Not great, really. It's a bit cloudy. Oh dear. How are things where you are Vineeta? Where are you? I'm in Plymouth. OK Plymouth - we've got opposite ends of the country here, Durham and Plymouth. It's north against south. Sorry, Vineeta, what's the weather like in Plymouth? Not too bad. Quite sunny. Now, some people say that the British talk about the weather all the time. Well, we don't talk about it all the time, but it is true that we talk about it a lot. I think one reason for that is that the weather here changes a lot. You can never be sure of the weather in Britain - it's often a surprise - so there is always something to say about it. But we don't often have long conversations about the weather. It's a very useful way of starting a conversation with someone, especially someone that you don't know very well, in a shop for example. You can say “Nice weather isn't it?” or “What terrible weather we're having”, or “What a lovely day”. The person will respond and then probably move the conversation on to another topic. One more thing about the weather. A lot of people think that the British use the phrase “It's raining cats and dogs”. Now, this phrase does exist in English, but I must say that I've never used it in my life, and I don't remember anyone saying it to me either. It really isn't very common, and it's probably best not to use it yourself. It really isn't very natural. Before I go, I'd like to tell you about a useful phrase that I noticed in this podcast. Listen to this extract. Gemma has just shown Carolina her new flat. Listen to the phrases she uses when she says goodbye. Right - I think that's everything, I'm going to get back. I'm sure you want some time to unpack your stuff. Some of the other girls in your flat are here already. You'll probably meet them here in the kitchen a bit later. OK. Thanks Gemma. Thanks for showing me around. No problem. I'll probably see you around. OK. See you. I'm sure you'll have a great time in Newcastle. Did you notice that Gemma says “I'll probably see you around”? Gemma hasn't made any arrangements to see Carolina again, and they aren't doing the same course, but because they both study at the same university, they might meet one day in the café or in a corridor. So she says “I'll probably see you around”. Try to use “I'll probably see you around” when you say goodbye to someone this week. OK. That's all from me today. I'll talk to you all again on the next podcast. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time..\n",
            "Hello again and welcome to LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number six. I'm Tess - from London. And he's Ravi, from Manchester. Hello. And I have to say to the listeners, Ravi has just arrived. What happened Ravi? Oversleep? Oh, I've had a nightmare journey. The underground was closed for some reason so I had to get a bus and of course the bus was absolutely packed because the underground was closed and the traffic was awful. What a nightmare. Still, I got here. Just in time. What about you? Was your journey OK? Well, I came in the car this morning. It was busy, but not too bad, you know. Ah well, you see. I was nearly late but you know - I use public transport because I care about the planet and the environment, but if you want to take your car.. You use public transport because you haven't got a driving licence. You won't want a lift home then in my terrible car, will you? Oh, very kind, thanks - that'll be lovely. Hey - I know what I wanted to ask you - your cat - has it got a name yet? Yes. Yes, he has. He's called Oscar. Oscar? Hmm. I quite like that. Why Oscar? I don't know, to be honest. He just looks like an Oscar. He's so cute Ravi. Hmm. I still think you should have called him Gordon. How are you today Gordon? Fine, thanks Ravi. Gordon's our producer - and king of the terrible jokes. We'll hear from him again later. But now, on with the show. Tess, what have we got? We've got all sorts. We've got the quiz, we've got Kazakhstan, we've got Carolina's new flatmates and we've got I'd Like to Meet. Do you want to tell us about it? OK. In this part of the podcast we ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And we ask them to explain why. So let's say hello to this week's guest, Vanessa, from Cambridge. Hi Vanessa. Hello. It's great to meet you both. It's nice to meet you too. And what do you do Vanessa? I'm a student. I study law. Law? So you're going to be a lawyer - that's a good job to have. Well, yes, I hope so. Were you born in Cambridge or do you study there? Both actually. I've lived there all my life, - and now I study there too. So you live at home with your parents right? No, I live in university accommodation - I think it's better. Well, you probably have a lot more fun. Yes, it's good. Now it's time to answer the question. So Vanessa, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? Frida Kahlo, the painter. OK. I've heard the name - there was a film wasn't there? But I don't know anything about her. Yeah, It was a good film - with Salma Hayek - she was Frida. Yeah, great film. Loved it. Frida Kahlo was Mexican, she was born at the beginning of the century and she died in the 1950s. When she was nineteen she was in a horrible bus accident. She had terrible injuries - I won't describe them all, but she had to have a lot of operations, and she was in bed for a long time. She liked painting, so her mother bought a mirror and put it over her bed. So she started painting pictures of herself - self portraits. And she never stopped painting after that. The pictures are a bit strange though aren't they. I'm not sure I'd like one in my living room. Well yes and no. Some people think that she was a surrealist, like Salvador Dali - that she painted dreams - but that isn't true. She painted her life - all the things that happened to her. And her life was a bit strange - or let's say 'unusual' - so the pictures are 'unusual' too. They're her life - her paintings tell her story. Because of the accident she couldn't have children - and you see that in her pictures too. I love her. Madonna collects her paintings - she once said that she couldn't be friends with anyone who doesn't like Frida Kahlo. She's incredibly famous now - one of her paintings - 'Roots' I think it was - was sold in 2006 for five and a half million dollars. Five and a half million dollars! I wouldn't mind that in my living room. Well yes - I think Frida would be very surprised too. That's what I'd like to tell her if I could meet her - how famous she is now, and how much people - especially women - love her work. She'd probably like to see the film too. Yes - that's true. It would be really interesting to hear what she thinks of it. I think I'm going to look at some of her pictures on the internet. You've got me interested now. And try and see the film if you get the chance - it's called “Frida”. I will. Thanks a lot for that Vanessa - and good luck with your law course. It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot. Yes, thanks Vanessa. That was great. And don't forget that we'd like to hear from you. Why not write and tell us about who you'd like to meet? You can send your own or you can look at what other people have sent in by checking out our website. So, as usual, it's quiz time next. Tess? What have we got? We're going to play 'Beginning With' again. And, I hope, we've got our two players ready on the telephone. Hello? Will? Hi Tess. and Jodie. Hello Let's start with you Jodie. Where are you calling from? From Cardiff. In Wales. Do you like it? Yeah, it's great. It's a capital city, you know, so there's quite a lot to do. And what do you do Jodie? I'm still at school. I'm 16 so I'm doing my GCSE exams this year. OK. Well good luck with them and good luck with the game today. Now, Will. Where are you? In Peterborough. Ah, OK. I know where that is. And what's it like? Erm, it's a bit boring really. Like, there isn't really anything to do for people my age. Oh dear. I'm sure it's not that bad. How old are you? I'm 16 as well. I'm at school, like Jodie. OK. Well, good luck to you too Will. I know you both know what to do but I'll quickly remind you. I'll ask the questions and to answer you press any button on your phone and we'll hear a buzzer. Let's hear your buzzers. Will. . OK. Jodie. . OK. The questions tell you what letter the answer starts with. So, I might say 'A form of transport beginning with 'T'' - and you can say 'train' or 'tram' or another transport that begins with 'T'. OK? Ready? Yep. Then let's go. Remember it's first one to three. Fingers on buzzers. Can you name. a fruit beginning with 'P'. Jodie. Pear Yes. One nil to Jodie. A colour beginning with 'P' Will. Purple. Yes. One one. An animal beginning with 'W'. Will again. Wolf. Right. Two one to Will. A country beginning with 'A'. Will. Africa. No. Sorry. No. A country, not a continent. Jodie? Argentina. Yes. Two two. So the next one is the decider. Ready? A sport beginning with 'B' Jodie! Badminton Yes! Well done Jodie. And bad luck Will. Jodie wins this week's LearnEnglish book token to buy any book you want. What kind of book are you going to buy Jodie? Oh, I don't know. I'll have to think. Probably like, a novel or something. OK, well enjoy it, whatever it is - the book token will be in the post on its way to you today. Thank you both for playing and remember, if you're listening, we'd like to hear your ideas for games we can play. Send them to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. You know we'd love to hear them. Right. It's time for Our Person In. I'm looking forward to this. In this part of the podcast we hear from different people around the world and this time, Rebecca Dalton is Our Woman in Kazakhstan. On a cold winter's morning, with thick snow on the ground around us, I watched the magnificent golden eagle fly high into the sky above us before returning to the arm of the berkutchy and sit on his thick leather glove. I had travelled for over 6 hours on difficult roads to meet this man - the name berkutchy means 'the eagle king'. The journey gave me an idea of just how big - and how empty - Kazakhstan is. It is the ninth biggest country in the world, bigger than all of western Europe, yet it has a population of only fifteen million so most of the country is almost empty. And this empty countryside has everything; a major mountain range on the border with China, great lakes and rivers, deserts and plains. Most importantly for Kazakhstan, it also has oil - perhaps twenty per cent of the world's supply - and many valuable metals can be found here. Over ten years ago, Kazakhstan moved its capital city. The new capital, Astana, is full of new buildings designed by famous international architects - a thoroughly modern city. Yet it is out here on the empty plains watching the golden eagle fly that you get a true feeling of this little known country. The oil and valuable metals will bring changes to Kazakhstan in the years to come but you feel - and hope - that the berkutchy will continue to fly his eagles in this wonderful, lonely space. It's amazing isn't it? Kazakhstan is absolutely huge but most of us don't know anything at all about it. Yeah. It sounds fantastic though, doesn't it? You say that about everywhere - New Zealand, South Africa It's true, I know. I'd love to travel round the world one day and see all of these places. By public transport? OK. But I really do want to travel. But the next best thing, listeners, is hearing about your countries so do remember that you can send your texts to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Tell us something interesting about your city or your country. That would be great. Now it's time for Your Turn. Your Turn is when we go out in the street to find out what people think. This time the question was.. \"How green are you?\" Nice one. “How green are you?” - what do you do to help save the planet? Like I use public transport. OK. Let's hear what people said. What do I do to help save the planet? Not enough. I hate to say it, but it's true, I mean, I always try to remember not to use plastic bags or recycle or whatever but I always forget. I really have to try to do more. Well, we recycle pretty much everything we can, you know, bottles, cans, newspapers and all that but to be honest we don't do much else. I do as much as I can. You have to, you know? We all have to. I don't take short-haul flights anymore - I used to fly down to London quite a lot - and of course I recycle and everything else I can. I know I'm not going to make myself popular saying this but I don't really do very much. Look - there are factories all over the world putting out loads and loads of pollution every single day and I don't see how saving your old newspapers is going to help apart from making people feel good about themselves. I'll tell you the greenest thing I do - I grow almost all my own vegetables. I've really started thinking about where my food comes from and the food miles and that - you know, like I won't buy food that's been flown here from Australia or something. They make me feel a bit guilty. Some people do so much. I feel like the first woman who said she didn't do enough. I don't think I do enough. I do recycle things though. Me too. It's difficult though, isn't it? Anyway, remember, listeners, that we'd love to know what you think. How green are you? What do you do to help save the planet? You can write and tell us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Right. Now it's time to join Carolina again in Newcastle. Carolina is from Venezuela and she's come to Britain to live, study and have fun. She's at Newcastle University in the north east of England, studying Environmental Science. Last time we listened Carolina had just arrived and met her new flatmates at the university. Let's see where she is this time.  ... and it starts on Friday afternoon. Anyway, thank you Emily - that would have been really difficult without you. No problem. Are you coming to the Societies Bazaar? The what? Oh, sorry, the Societies Bazaar. The meeting for all the different student clubs at the university. Oh, yes, I know. I read about it. It's a bit different from universities at home but I think I understand. All the different clubs come to this - 'bazaar' - is that right? - and all the first year students join the clubs they want to. But remember that the first year students are called 'freshers' - all of this is important Carolina! Freshers! That's right. Because we're fresh, I suppose. Can you join as many clubs as you like? Yeah, as many as you want. But you have to pay, remember. It's in there - over there. It looks quite crowded. Shall we go in?  ... I don't know really - it's a bit too crowded for me. Listen, I'm going to go and join the queue for the basketball club. Do you want to meet back here in about 20 minutes? OK. I want to join the International Students Society but the queue is too big. I'm going to have a look round and wait for the queue to get smaller. OK. I'll see you back here, yeah? In about 20 minutes? OK. See you later.  ... Conservation Society - just five pounds membership. Come and join us. Erm, hi. Erm. I'm not quite sure what the Conservation Society is. Can you tell me a bit about it? Definitely. We go out into the countryside and we do things to help the environment - sort of countryside management - you know, erm looking after forests erm.. making the countryside better for animals and birds and things erm.. it's quite hard to explain really. Ah, look, here comes the society president. I'm sure he can tell you about it better than me. Jamie. Hi. We met on the train, remember? Carolina! Hi. How are you? Did you find your room OK and everything? Yes. Thank you. And you're the president of the Conservation Society? Your friend was telling me about it. Yes. Are you going to join? Remember I was telling you about the countryside in Northumbria? North of Newcastle. It's really beautiful. You should join and come and see it with us. I'm sure it's a bit different from Venezuela. OK. You've persuaded me. What do I have to do to join? Excellent. You just have to fill in this form. I'll fill it in for you. Carolina. What's your surname? Del Barco Do you want me to spell it? Yeah, please. Is it one word or two words? Two words. d-e-l.. small 'd', then capital B, a-r-c-o And have you got your email address yet? My university email? No, not yet. But you can use another address. It's caro del b eighty eight @ ready net.V-Z. Can you spell that for me? OK. It's Caro del B - c-a-r-o-d-e-l-b - all one word. Eighty eight. At. Ready Net - r-e-a-d-y-n-e-t dot v-z.  ... net dot v z. OK, great. And have you got a mobile number yet? Yes. Oh, just a moment, I'll have to look at my phone. I haven't learnt it yet. Here it is. Oh double three four seven four six one oh three seven. Oh double three... Oh double three four seven four six one oh three seven.  ...four seven four six one oh three seven. Right. Thanks. What department are you in Carolina? I can send you our booklet. I haven't finished writing it yet. Environmental Science. In the Daish building. Can you send it there? Yeah. No problem. The booklet's got all the information in it. We usually meet on Sundays and talk about what we're going to do and things. We're all going out to the pub this Thursday, if you want to come. I'll give you a ring and let you know where we're going, if that's OK? Yeah. Great. Right. That's everything. Actually, there's one more thing. I seem to remember that you said you'd take me to lunch. Do you want to go and get a sandwich somewhere? Yes, I did, didn't I? OK. Erm I just need to talk to my friend... Were you in any societies at university Tess? Loads. Well, I joined lots of societies in my first year but I didn't really do a lot. I was in the cycling society. And I used to play volleyball. Anyway, what about Jamie and Carolina going out for lunch, eh? What about it? Oh, I see what you mean. Hmm. Well, that's almost everything for today but a podcast wouldn't be a podcast without a joke from Gordon. Are you ready Gordon? I am, Ravi. Another special one for you today. I'm sure it is Gordon. All of your jokes are 'special'. In their own way. Let's hear it. Anyway, a rabbit walks into a butcher's shop and says “Have you got any carrots?”. And the butcher says “No. This is a butcher's shop - we don't sell carrots,” and the rabbit says “OK” and goes out of the shop. An hour later, the rabbit comes back. “Have you got any carrots?” And the butcher says “No, I told you, this is a butcher's shop - we haven't got any carrots”. An hour later - it happens again, and an hour after that, it happens again. Well, the butcher's getting really annoyed. Next time the rabbit comes in - “Have you got any carrots?” the butcher says “Look, I've told you - we don't have any carrots here. If you come back to this shop one more time I'm going to take a hammer, take some nails and I'm going to nail your ears to the floor! OK?” So, the rabbit goes away. But, guess what, an hour later, the rabbit comes back and walks into the shop. “Have you got any nails?” “No” says the butcher. “Have you got any carrots?” Actually Gordon, I think that's the best one so far. You're getting better. Right. We have to go now but don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our English teacher. After every show, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, don't go away, but I'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Bye! Don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Hi, my name's Tom. At the end of every podcast, I talk about some of the language that you heard, and some ways to help you learn English. The first thing I want to talk about today is the word 'like'. 'Like' can be used in lots of different ways in English. Listen to Tess talking to Jodie at the beginning of the quiz. Listen for the word 'like'. Let's start with you Jodie. Where are you calling from? From Cardiff. In Wales. Do you like it? Yeah, it's great. It's a capital city, you know, so there's quite a lot to do. This is the use of 'like' that I'm sure you already know. It's being used as a verb. Tess asks Jodie if she enjoys living in Cardiff. Now listen to Tess again, talking to Will this time. Listen for the word 'like'. Is it a verb here? Now, Will. Where are you? In Peterborough. Ah, OK. I know where that is. And what's it like? Erm, it's a bit boring really. Tess asks Will \"What is it like?\". She's asking him to describe Peterborough. Will could say \"It's very big\" or \"It's very quiet\" or \"It's got a lot of shops\". In the question \"What's it like?\", 'like' is a preposition, not a verb. The meaning isn't connected to the meaning of 'like' as a verb. It's a very common question in English - when we want someone to describe something to us, we often use \"What's it like?\". A good example is \"What's the weather like in London?\". We want the person to tell us if it's raining or sunny, if the weather's good or bad. Or \"What's your teacher like?\". We want you to describe your teacher. Maybe \"She's young\" or \"She's blonde with blue eyes\" or \"She's very friendly\" or even \"She's terrible!\" - any answer that describes her in some way. Now listen to Tess and Jodie again. Listen to how Jodie uses 'like'. Yes! Well done Jodie. And bad luck Will. Jodie wins this week's Learn English book token to buy any book you want. What kind of book are you going to buy Jodie? Oh, I don't know. I'll have to think. Probably like, a novel or something. Hmmm. Jodie's going to buy “probably like, a novel or something”. She isn't using 'like' as a verb or a preposition here. She's using it as a 'filler'. A 'filler' is something that we say to give us more time to think, for example 'erm' or 'uh', or 'I don't know'. You will hear young native English speakers use 'like' a lot in this way. You'll hear for example “Yeah, it's like, really cool”. Remember that this is a very informal way to speak. If you want to use 'like' in this way, then only do it with groups of young friends - and not in more formal situations, with your teacher for example. Next time you watch a 'teenage' film in English, listen for 'like' used in this way. I'm sure you'll notice it a lot. It can be difficult to know which words and phrases are informal in English. You may hear a new phrase in a film or a song and want to use it. But can you be sure that you'll use it in the right situations with the right people? A good learners' dictionary can help you with this. It will tell you when a word is informal. Most dictionaries use the letters infml, next to the word. This means 'informal', so then you can make a note in your vocabulary notebook so that you won't forget. Let me give you an example. The word 'children' isn't formal or informal. You can use 'children' in any situation, with your friends or even if you are talking to the Queen!. It's never wrong. It's what we call a 'neutral' word. But the word 'kids' - which can mean exactly the same as children - is a lot more informal. It would sound strange to talk about 'kids' at a formal party for example. Check the word 'kids' in your dictionary now and see if it tells you that it's an informal word. Now let's talk about something different. When someone tells you their phone number or address, it can be difficult to remember it and write it down at the same time. It can be difficult for native speakers, but may be more difficult if English isn't your first language. Of course, you can say “I'm sorry - could you say that again?” or “Could you repeat that please?”. But listen to what Jamie does when Carolina tells him her phone number. Here it is. Oh double three four seven four six one oh three seven. Oh double three... Oh double three four seven four six one oh three seven.  ...four seven four six one oh three seven. Right. Thanks. Jamie can only remember the first three numbers. So he repeats them “Oh double three” and then he pauses. He stops and waits. This shows Carolina that he wants her to repeat the rest of the numbers for him. He doesn't need to ask. We do this a lot in English - maybe you do it in your language too - or maybe not. We do it with telephone numbers, addresses and even names if someone is spelling them out for us. If your English teacher says, “The homework is workbook, page 65, exercises 1, 3 and 7” - and you can't remember and write it down at the same time, you can say “Workbook page 65..” and stop. Your teacher will then repeat “Exercises 1, 3 and 7”. Here's another thing that I noticed in this podcast. Listen to Will and Jodie introducing themselves at the beginning of the quiz. They're both sixteen years old, so listen to what Will says. I'm still at school. I'm 16 so I'm doing my GCSE exams this year. I'm 16 as well. Yes, he says \"I'm sixteen as well\". 'As well' means the same as 'too' in this phrase. You can say \"I'm sixteen too\" or you can say \"I'm sixteen as well\". But be careful. You can say \"Me too\" but we don't say \"Me as well\". If your friend says \"I'm going to Ana's party tomorrow\", you can say, \"Me too\" or you can say \"I'm going too\" or you can say \"I'm going as well\". Try to use 'as well' when you're speaking English this week. OK. That's all from me today. I'll talk to you all again on the next podcast. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello hello and welcome to the LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number seven. I'm Ravi, from Manchester And I'm Tess, from London. As usual we've got lots of interesting stuff for you to listen to - we've got the quiz, we've got Carolina and.. we've got our producer Gordon, as usual. Hello Gordon. Hi Tess. Hi Ravi. Hiya. Have you had your hair cut Ravi? I have, yeah, do you like it? Yeah, I do, it's nice. It's quite short for you. Shorter than usual. Are you changing your image? No, not really. I just fancied a change, you know. And I've got a big family party this weekend so I thought I'd get my hair cut for that. You want to look smart. Fair enough. What's the party? It's my dad's fiftieth birthday. My mum's organised a surprise party for him. Oh, brilliant. What a nice idea. Your mum and dad live in Brighton now, don't they? Yes. They moved down there a couple of years ago. My big sister's still in Manchester though. How many brothers and sisters have you got again? I can never remember. I've got one older sister and two younger brothers. Hang on a sec. That's them there. You keep a picture of your family in your wallet? How sweet. Yeah. Course I do. That's Asha, my big sister, there. She's 3 years older than me. She's really pretty. It's a shame our listeners can't see this. You do realise that Ravi, don't you. I know I know - but it'll only take a minute. That one's Deepak - he's at university in Bristol and that's Vikram. He's still at school. Hey, your brothers are both really good-looking. What happened to you? I knew you were going to say that. Only joking Ravi. Anyway, we'd better move on - we've got a lot to get through. Right. So let's start with I'd Like to Meet. OK. In this part of the podcast we ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And we ask them to explain why. So let's say hello to this week's guest, Muhammed from Manchester. Hi Muhammed. Welcome to 'I'd like to meet'. Hi Tess and Ravi Hi Muhammed. So you're a Manchester boy like me. Good football team eh. Which one? Which one!? No - don't tell me you're a Manchester City supporter! Noooo! I'm afraid so. Sorry Ravi. Ravi can't speak - so I'll continue. What do you do Muhammed? I'm at college at the moment - but when I finish I want to join the police. You want to be a policeman. What made you decide to do that? My uncle's a policeman. I don't know really - it's just something I've always wanted to do. OK. Now, who are you going to talk about today Muhammed - who's the person that you'd like to meet - if you had the chance? I want to talk about Muhammed Yunus. OK. Off you go. Well, he's from Bangladesh - from Chittagong actually - that's where my dad's family came from - we've still got relations living there. And I think everyone knows his name now - since he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 - well he won it with his bank. A bank won the Nobel peace prize? Yes. The Grameen Bank? Microcredit? Well, yeah, it sounds familiar. It's a bank for poor people. Perhaps you'd better explain how it works Muhammed. Well, it all started when he - Dr Yunus - he's a professor of economics - he visited a village outside Chittagong, and he talked to a very poor woman - and he realised that she only needed a small amount of money - just a couple of dollars - and then she could buy materials to make things and sell them and earn money. She couldn't borrow money from the bank because they didn't believe that she would pay it back. He found more people in the same situation - think it was forty-two people in the village - and all of them together only needed twenty-seven dollars -- that's all they needed to be able to start making money for themselves. So he lent them the money - and they all paid it back to him later. Then he went to other villages and did the same thing. So he started his own bank - the Grameen Bank - to lend small amounts of money to poor people, mostly women actually. That's what microcredit means. What kinds of things do they use the money for? Well, a woman can buy a cow, and then she can sell the milk and pay to send her children to school. Or she could buy a mobile phone - the villages don't have telephones - and then people can pay to use her phone. They aren't expensive things - it just means that poor people can start to earn money. And now the Grameen Bank lends millions and millions of dollars to people. And they all pay it back? Most of them yes - something like 99 per cent. And now countries like the United States and Britain are using the idea too, it's all over the world - so - well, I think he's brilliant - a real hero. That's what I'd like to say to him. Well thank you Muhammed. That was really interesting. Thanks. There's an old joke isn't there - something about 'a bank will only lend you money if you can prove that you don't need it'. Well yes - it's true isn't it! I'd never really thought about it before. No, nor me. OK. Let's move on now to quiz time. A little game to make you think. Let's see who we've got on the phone today. Hello? Hi Ravi. Niall? Hello Niall, where are you calling from? From Belfast. Ah, Northern Ireland. Lovely. And what do you do Niall? Well, I work in a shop but I'm going to university soon. OK. What are you going to study? Spanish Ah. Buenos dias! Buenos dias, Ravi Actually, that's all the Spanish I know. OK, so we've got Niall from Belfast and Nikki. Hi Nikki. Hi Ravi And where are you from Nikki? From Luton. North of London. I know it well. My uncle lives there. And what do you do Nikki? I work in a garden centre. Very nice. Right. We're going to play 'Something Beginning with' again. I'm sure you both know how to play but I'll explain the rules. I'm going to ask the questions and when you know the answer you press any button on your phone. Let's hear your buzzer, Niall. And yours Nikki. Right. I ask the questions and give you a letter. So, I might say for example \"A sport beginning with 'F'\" and when you think of a sport beginning with 'F' you press your buzzer. Can either of you think of a sport beginning with 'F'? Football Exactly. The winner is the first person to get three answers right. Are you both ready? Ready/OK Then let's go. Can you tell me a fruit beginning with 'C'? Nikki Cherry Yes. One nil to Nikki. Can you tell me a means of transport beginning with 'T'? Niall. Train. Yes. One one. Next one. Can you tell me an animal beginning with 'F'? Niall. Fox. Yes. Two one to Niall. Can you tell me an item of clothing beginning with 'S' Nikki. Socks Yes. Two two. So this one is the decider. Ready? Can you tell me a vegetable beginning with 'C'? Niall! Cauliflower. Cauliflower. Yes. So Niall is today's winner. Well done Niall. Bad luck Nikki. The podcast book token will be on its way to you soon to buy any book you want. You can get a Spanish book. I might do that Ravi. OK. Thanks to both of you for playing and the rest of you, remember you can send your ideas for games to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Right. Let's move on now to Our Person In. This is the part of the podcast when we hear from different people all over the world. This time, Susan Harold is Our Woman in Egypt. When I first arrived in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, 10 years ago, I was working as a teacher. I had lessons in different parts of the city and I had to take a lot of taxis - the underground in Cairo doesn't cover many areas of this huge city. Black and white taxis are a familiar sight here and it's a cheap way to travel but I found it very difficult. The big question was - how much do I have to pay? I watched my Egyptian friends in taxis. They didn't ask the driver “how much?” at the start of the journey, there was no meter in the car to say how much and they didn't ask 'how much?' at the end of the journey - they just handed over the correct amount of money and walked away. “But how do you know how much to pay?” I would ask. A shrug of the shoulders, “We just know.” Gradually, over the years, I have started to understand the payment system in Cairo taxis. There are several things to think about. How far are you going? How long will you spend in the car? What time of day is it? How many people are in the car? My Egyptian friends can make all the calculations and know exactly how much to pay without a word being spoken. Unfortunately, the rules can be different for tourists. You might have to pay more if you travel to or from one of the big international hotels in the city. In fact, you might have to pay a little bit just because you're a tourist. But don't let that stop you taking taxis in Cairo. In my opinion, there's no better way to really see the life of this amazing city. I went to Cairo on holiday a couple of years ago and it was unbelievable. I mean, it's a fantastic city, the pyramids are just incredible and everything but it's just so big and the traffic oof! Did you take a taxi? I didn't. I was too scared to cross the road most of the time. I'd love to go back though. Well. listeners, remember that you have the chance to join in too. This time we'd like to hear about taking a taxi in your country. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Actually, taxi might be one of the answers in the next part of the podcast. It's time for Your Turn when we go out into the street to find out what people think. And the question this time was 'What's the best way to travel?' Actually, that's quite a difficult question. Erm.. I think I'd say flying. Except it's really bad for the planet. Well, let's hear what our people said. Oh, by train. Definitely. You know, you can get up and walk around and you can't really do that in a plane or a car. And you can just sit and watch the world go by. Not too fast, not too slow. Just right. Well, I shouldn't really say this but I love driving. It gives you that feeling of independence that you don't get with any other transport. You can just go wherever you want. The world's your oyster. I'd love to drive all the way across America one day. I know lots of people don't like it but I really like flying. I still think it's amazing that we can do it. When you stop to think about it, it's incredible. And I love the view from up there. Mind you, it's really bad for the planet, I suppose. Well I've travelled on the underground today but if I had to say what the best way to travel is I'd say bicycle. I think it's the satisfaction of getting around by your own effort. And it's good for you. I'd probably say 'on foot', really. I mean, it depends. I love walking in the countryside - it's not so much fun in the city, I guess. I'll tell you what isn't the best way to travel. Flying. I hate it. I'm terrified. Nah, I disagree, I really like flying. What about you Tess? I'm surprised that nobody said 'boat'. I love travelling by boat. We went on a boat holiday when I was a kid - I loved it. And we'd love to hear what all of you out there think. What do you think is the best way to travel? Write and let us know. learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. OK. Time now to find out how Carolina's getting on in Newcastle. Carolina, you might remember, is a student from Venezuela who's come to Britain to live, study and have fun. Last time we listened, Carolina joined some societies at the university but this time she's not feeling too well. Hi Emily. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you had a seminar at 10 o'clock. I did, but I'm not feeling very well. Bless you! You sound terrible. You'd better go to bed. Did you tell your tutor that you were ill? No, I was early, he wasn't there, but I left a note on the door. I said I was sorry, but I was very constipated. Constipated? Why did you tell him you were constipated? Well, because I am. See, I can't stop sneezing. You don't sneeze when you're constipated. Constipated means that you can't go to the toilet, you know, you're blocked.., you know, you try and try but you can't. well you know. Oh no! I was thinking in Spanish! In Spanish we say I'm constipada! Well in English it's a cold. You say I've got a cold - a bad cold. I knew that! I've got a cold! What a stupid mistake! It's because I'm ill - my head feels like it's full of, I don't know, .. cake. Cake?! And I left a note on the door. Everyone's going to laugh at me. No they won't. Don't be silly. Everyone knows English isn't your first language - you made a mistake that's all. But they won't know it's a mistake. They'll think I wanted to tell everyone that I was constipated, that I couldn't go to the toilet. Oh, I want to go home to Venezuela. Look, it's not ten o'clock yet. I'll go the room and take the note off the door and explain to. who? Professor Grogan. Room 102. It'll be too late. And you can go to the chemist's and get yourself something to take. Then come back here and go to bed. You look awful. Have some hot lemon and honey - that's what my mother always gives me. OK, thanks a lot Emily. Good morning. Can I help you? Yes please. I can't stop sneezing. Have you got anything I can take? Is it a cold or an allergy? It's a cold. I don't have any allergies, at least I don't think so. Have you got any other symptoms? A sore throat? A headache? A cough? Yes, my throat hurts - it hurts when I eat or drink, and my head hurts too. Have you got a temperature? A temperature? What's that? I'm sorry, my English is terrible today. You know, have you got a high temperature, do you feel hot? Is your face hot? You mean a fever? Yes, yes, I think so, my face is hot but my body feels cold. OK. It sounds like a bad cold. Let's see... this should help. Are you allergic to any medicines? No, no I'm not. How often do I have to take it? Two spoonfuls, four times a day. The instructions are on the bottle. Don't take it if you're driving, it might make you sleepy. That's OK. I just want to go to bed. Should I take anything else? Vitamin C will help. Here you are. Take one of these three times a day. And drink plenty of water. Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking? Venezuela. I've only been here a few weeks. Ah. Venezuela. I expect our English weather is a bit too cold for you then. Spend the rest of the day in bed and keep warm. You'll feel a lot better tomorrow. I hope so. If you still feel terrible in two or three days then you should go and see a doctor. Thank you very much. And how much is that for the medicines? Poor Carolina. It's terrible when you feel ill in a foreign country. \"I am constipated.\" Oh, stop it Ravi. Yeah, you're right. It is quite funny though. And she got some medicine so I'm sure she's OK. Anyway, that's almost the end of another podcast but, as usual, before we go, we're going to hear from Gordon with another one of his amazing jokes. Gordon? Yep. What have you got for us? Another dog, Ravi. Come on then, let's hear it. Right. A dog goes to put an advert in a newspaper. In the lonely hearts column, you know. To find a girlfriend? Right. Anyway, the assistant at the newspaper says \"That's fine, just fill in your name and address on this form and then write your advert in the box underneath.\" “OK”, says the dog. He fills in the form and then he stops to think for a bit and then he writes in the box - \"woof, woof, woof. Woof, woof. Woof, woof, woof, woof.\" He gives the paper to the assistant and she has a look at it and says to the dog, “You know you've got nine woofs here - you can have an extra one for no extra charge - it's ten words for £5. Why don't you add another 'woof'?” The dog looks really confused. “Another 'woof'? That wouldn't make any sense at all”. I quite like that one. Your dog jokes are the best ones Gordon. You should concentrate on them. What do you think Tess? Quite funny - but don't look for work as a comedian just yet Gordon. Anyway. That's everything from us for this time. After this little break you'll hear from Tom, our English teacher who'll talk about the language you heard and give you ideas to help you learn. So we'll say goodbye but don't go away. And remember to keep your emails coming to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Bye!. Hi, my name's Tom. At the end of every podcast, I talk about some of the language that you heard, and some ways to help you learn English. Today I want to look at some verbs that we use to describe things - or to describe the idea that we have about them. Listen to Emily and Carolina talking. Remember, Carolina is ill. What phrase does Emily use to describe her? Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you had a seminar at 10 o'clock. I did, but I'm not feeling very well. Bless you! You sound terrible. Emily says “You sound terrible!” We use the verb 'sound' when we are talking about something we can hear. Emily can hear that Carolina is ill from her voice, and also from her sneezes. So she uses 'sound'. If your friend tells you all about her new boyfriend, but you haven't met him yet, you can say “He sounds nice.” You have the idea that he is nice from what she has said about him, from what you've heard. So you can use 'sound'. Now listen to Emily again. How does she describe Carolina this time? And you can go to the chemist's and get yourself something to take. Then come back here and go to bed. You look awful. Have some hot lemon and honey - that's what my mother always gives me. This time Emily says “You look awful”. This time, she can see that Carolina is ill - it isn't just her voice now. Her eyes are probably red, and she might be very pale. So this time Emily says “You look awful”. If your friend shows you a photograph of her new boyfriend, and you haven't met him yet, you can say “He looks nice”. You have the idea that he is nice from the photo - from what you can see. So you can use 'look'. A lot of languages use words that translate as 'seem' or 'appear' in all of these situations, so using 'look' and 'sound' might be a bit strange for you. Try to notice people using 'look' and 'sound' in the English that you read and hear, and try to use those phrases yourself. Now I want to talk about something that's very important when you learn a new language. Do you remember Carolina's problem with the word 'constipated'? Constipated? Why did you tell him you were constipated? Well, because I am. See, I can't stop sneezing. You don't sneeze when you're constipated. Constipated means that you can't go to the toilet, you know, you're blocked.., you know, you try and try but you can't. well you know. Oh no! I was thinking in Spanish! In Spanish we say I'm constipada! This is a very common problem. It depends what language you speak, but sometimes there are words in your language that are very similar to a word in English. And very often they have the same meaning too. For example, 'arriver' in French is similar to 'arrive' in English, and the meaning is the same. These words can help you a lot. But be careful! As we just heard with Carolina, sometimes the words don't have the same meaning at all! The word 'constipada' in Spanish looks and sounds the same as the English word 'constipated'. But the meaning is completely different. We call these words 'false friends'. They look or sound the same as a word in another language - so you think they are 'friends' - but they don't have the same meaning. The German word for 'poison' sounds the same as the English word 'gift' - which means 'a present'. In Finnish, the word for 'cat' can sound like the English word 'kiss'. False friends can be very dangerous! When you hear a word in English that sounds or looks the same as a word in your language, the first thing to do is notice the context - the situation where you heard or saw the word, what the people were talking about. This will help you to understand the meaning of the word. Then, if you're still not sure, check the word in your English learners' dictionary. And finally, if it is a false friend, then make a note of it on a special page in your vocabulary notebook and make a really special effort to learn it - and remember it. It isn't easy - even people who speak English very well still make mistakes with false friends - just like Carolina did - when they're tired or not concentrating. Now let's look at a useful phrase that we use in English when we want to ask a personal question. Listen to Carolina and the chemist. What phrase does he use when he asks her a personal question? Vitamin C will help. Here you are. Take one of these three times a day. And drink plenty of water. Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking? Venezuela. I've only been here a few weeks. He says “Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking?” Of course, in a different situation, with your new classmates for example, “Where are you from?” isn't a very personal question, but the chemist doesn't know Carolina, and in this situation - Carolina is buying some medicine for her cold - Carolina might be offended - she might think the question isn't appropriate. So he adds “if you don't mind me asking”. This makes the question more polite. If you want to ask someone a question but you aren't sure if it's polite to ask, then use “if you don't mind me asking”. Just before I go, let me give you a phrase from the podcast that you can use. Listen to what we say in English when someone sneezes - atchoo!. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you had a seminar at 10 o'clock. I did, but I'm not feeling very well. Bless you! You sound terrible. You'd better go to bed. Did you tell your professor that you were ill? Yes, we say “Bless you!”. Some learners think that we say “God bless you” - well maybe that was the original phrase that people used a long time ago, but nowadays it's just “Bless you!”. Use it the next time someone sneezes near you! OK. That's all from me today. I'll talk to you all again on the next podcast. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! Or write to me about any interesting language that you noticed. In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello again and welcome to the LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number eight. I'm Tess, from London. And I'm Ravi, from Manchester. You're looking great as usual Tess, how are you? Thanks, Ravi. I'm very well thanks. How are you? I'm fine thanks. Actually, I'm very well. You know I told you I was looking for a new flat? Yes. Well, I found a new place over on Carswell Road - near the swimming pool. It's really nice. Much bigger than the one I'm in now. What's the rent like? Well, it is quite expensive, quite a bit more than I pay now. But it's a lot nicer. Great. When are you moving. Well, I wanted to ask you about that. What are you doing on Saturday? Nothing special. Why? Well, do you think you could help me move some stuff to my new place? Can you spare two or three hours in the afternoon? Yeah, I suppose so. You can say 'no' if you want to you know. No, it's OK, I don't mind. That's brilliant. Thank you. I'll tell you what, I'll make dinner for you at the new flat after we've moved my things. Does that sound OK? Ooh. That'll be lovely, thanks. Great. Have a think about what you want to eat. Right. Well, we'd better get on. Lots of things for you, as usual. We've got Gordon - hello Gordon Hello Gordon's our producer and king of the bad jokes. We've got the quiz, we've got fish in the bath we've got good and bad TV but first of all we've got I'd Like to Meet. And joining us today is Megan. Hello Megan. Hi Ravi. Where are you today Megan? I'm at home. In Reading. Oh yeah, I know it. Do you like it? It's OK. I quite like it, yeah. OK then Megan, tell us, who would you like to meet? I'd like to meet David Attenborough. Great choice. I know who David Attenborough is - I think anyone who watches television in Britain will know who he is - but maybe you can explain to people who don't watch television in Britain who David Attenborough is and what he's well known for. Well actually Ravi, David Attenborough's wildlife programmes have been seen by more than one billion people all over the world so I think people will know who he is. They might not know his name but I think they'll recognise him. Erm, he's a TV presenter and he makes programmes about nature and wildlife and the natural world and they are just fantastic. Erm.. I'll say the names of some of the programmes in case anyone recognises them, erm, there was Life on Earth, the Life of Birds, the Blue Planet, Planet Earth - there's been so many of them. And what is it about David Attenborough that you like? Oh, everything. He's getting quite old now - he's over 80 now, but he looks great - he's got really white hair. And I love his voice - he just sounds so interested in the animals that he's talking about and sometimes he gets really close to them and he's almost whispering but you can just see how interested and excited he is. I think the programmes are brilliant. But the other thing is that the programmes are always about the animals not about him. Y' know some presenters just talk about themselves all the time. I think his programmes are the best things on TV. So, you like animals then Megan? I love them. I want to be a vet. And what would you say to David Attenborough if you met him? Well, I'd like to say \"thank you\" I think for his programmes and tell him that I think they've been really important in telling people about climate change and global warming and the real things that are happening to animals because of what people do. I think his programmes have made a lot of people realise the problems animals have to face. And I'd like to ask him what he thinks will happen in the future, y'know, if it's too late to save the planet, kind of thing. Y'know. I think I'd really like to meet David Attenborough as well. I really love those programmes. Do you know what he said about TV advertisements Megan? No? He said he will never do an advertisement on TV. He says if people know you will take money to say you like something then they can't trust you anymore or believe what you say. Yeah. You really do trust him when you listen to him. Well, thanks Megan - that was great. And remember that we're always happy to hear from you so if you'd like to tell us about a TV presenter in your country you can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org, that's learnenglish - all one word - at- britishcouncil - all one word DOT org, that's o-r-g.

Remember if you're listening that you can send your ideas for games we can play to learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. OK. Time now for Our Person In. At the start of the podcast I promised you fish in the bath - and here they come. Bill Steadman is our man in Prague. When the huge fish tanks appear outside supermarkets here in Prague you know that it must be almost Christmas. The tanks are full of carp - the fish traditionally eaten at Christmas here in the Czech Republic and in other central European countries. For my first Christmas in the Czech Republic I found this tradition a little strange. Carp isn't usually eaten in Britain - it's a fish that is often full of small bones and the flavour is a little, well, different. But what I found really strange about the Czech habit of eating carp at Christmas is how they do it. People usually buy the fish from tanks outside supermarkets and take them home- alive - and put them in the bath. Spending a few days in clean bath water cleans the carp and makes it taste better when it is eaten on Christmas Eve. A friend of mine told me that when her son was four years old he asked why they were keeping the carp in the bath. “To clean it” she told him. Later that day my friend went to look at the carp in the bath and saw, to her horror, a bath full of bubbles. Her helpful son had added a generous handful of soap powder to the bath to make sure their carp was lovely and clean. That was one family that didn't eat carp that year. All my friends with children tell me that there is one golden rule - never give your carp a name. When Christmas Eve arrives you'll find it very difficult to explain to your children why their pet has suddenly disappeared. Ahh. So the poor children think they've got a fish as a pet and then it disappears and they have to eat it for Christmas. Poor things. What I want to know is how do they have a bath when the fish is in the bath? Do they just have a bath with the fish? Very strange. But anyway, if any of you has something interesting to tell us about what you eat at festivals in your country then write and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Now, let's move on to Your Turn, the part of our podcast when we find out what you think. This time round we asked a two part question - what are the best - and worst - things on TV. Let's hear some answers. Best thing - sport. I know people complain about it but it's all I watch, really. Worst thing - reality TV shows - definitely. There are hundreds of them and they are all completely stupid. Well, I like soap operas. I watch two or three of them, you know. You really feel like you know the characters. I've watched them for years. What do I always switch off? Probably the weather forecast. It's never right so what's the point in watching it? I don't watch much TV but I do like the nature documentaries. I saw one about whales and it was just amazing. I don't know how they do it. But apart from that, I don't know. There's too much sport on television. I just turn it off straight away. I can't really go to the cinema very often now I've got children so I like to watch films on TV. They don't have the most recent films but, you know, it's OK. That's what I watch mostly. I can't stand all the sport on TV though. It never ends! Erm.. what do I like? Have you seen Silver Fox? I love action programmes like that, you know, exciting things. It's better than the news and the political programmes and that. Bo-ring!. How about you Ravi. What would you say? Sport, I'm afraid. That's pretty much all I watch on TV. I watch DVDs most of the time. Let us know what you think - what are the best - and worst - things on TV? Send your answers to learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. OK. It's time now to catch up with Carolina. Carolina, you'll remember, is from Venezuela and she's come to England to live, study and have fun. She wasn't having much fun last time because she had a really bad cold but she's feeling better now and she's going out to the pub with some friends. Carolina! Hi! We're over here! Oh hi! I couldn't see you!  ... And the man says “I know. It is amazing. He hated the book”. Come and sit down. There's a space next to Henry. Excuse me, sorry. Hello Henry. Hi. And this is Helen, and Nigel, and Gemma and Jake. hi, hello, hi Carolina etc Hello everybody. Right. It's my round. Round? I don't understand. Haven't you ever been to a pub before? No, it's the first time. We take it in turns to buy a round - that's what you do in a pub. Everyone buys a round. But is a round a drink? No. One person buys a drink for everyone at the table - that's called a round. Then next time someone else buys one. Henry bought the first one and now Jake's buying the next one, so it's his round. But you don't have to. not if you don't want to.if you don't want a drink or something. Oh no, that's OK. I'll buy a round later. So, same again everybody? yes, yes please, yep, same again, same for me please. Carolina? What are you drinking? Oh dear I don't know. What is everyone else having? I'm having Newcastle Brown. It's a really good beer. From Newcastle of course. Ugh! It doesn't look like the beer I know. It's very dark! No, probably not. You probably drink lager - that's the pale beer, you know the light coloured one. We call it lager. Would you like one? No, I don't think so. I'll have a fruit juice - what have they got? Well, pineapple - that's what Helen's drinking, but besides that, I'm not sure. Come up to the bar with me and we'll ask. You can give me a hand with the drinks. OK, so that's two bottles of Newcastle Brown, a pint of lager, a half of lager, a Diet Coke, a pineapple juice - and whatever Carolina wants. So, are you enjoying Newcastle? Yes I am. I haven't seen much of it yet. I've just started classes and I had a really bad cold for a few days. But I like what I've seen. Y' being served? No. Um, two bottles of Newcastle Brown, a pint and a half of lager, a Diet Coke and a pineapple juice please. And what other fruit juices have you got? Pineapple, cranberry, mango, apple, and orange. Um, mango please. And a packet of crisps please - cheese and onion. Right you are. And how long have you known Jamie? We met on the train coming up from London. Well he seems to like you. Oh, does he?, Well I. That's eleven pounds fifty please. Here you are. And that's eight fifty change. Thanks. OK, let's get these back to the table. I'll take the lagers - if you can bring the if you can bring the juices and the crisps over, yeah? Oooh. Jamie seems to like Carolina. Well, well. I knew you'd say that. Do you buy rounds if you go to the pub, Tess? I don't usually. It can be really expensive, can't it? Anyway, at least Carolina knows what a round is now. I don't really go to the pub much anyway. I prefer to be outdoors. Gordon. I bet you're often in the pub. Surrounded by people laughing at your jokes. That's right Ravi. Is it time for your joke now? Come on then. I hope it's a good one. They're all good, Ravi. Ready for it? Go on. OK then. There were these two married couples, OK? And one couple invited the other for dinner one night. So, they have a lovely meal and after dinner the two men were in the kitchen doing the washing up and chatting and the two women were in the living room, having a chat. One of the men says to the other, “We went to a great restaurant last week - had a fantastic meal. The best Indian food I've had in ages. Excellent. And really cheap too”. And the other man says “Sounds great. I love Indian food. What was the restaurant called?” And the first man says, “Oh gosh. My memory's terrible. Now, let me think for a minute. You know that flower? It's red - smells nice. Romantic - you give it to people you love on Valentine's Day. What do you call it?” “A rose” says the other man. “Yes! That's it!” and he shouts into the living room, “Rose! What was the name of the Indian restaurant we went to last Saturday?” My dad's like that. His memory's awful. Yeah, mine too. Actually I forget things as well. Thanks for the joke erm what's his name again? Very funny Ravi. Thanks Gordon. And that's all from us for today but don't go away because our English teacher, Tom, will be here in a little while talking about what you heard and ways to help you learn. So, it's goodbye from me and Ravi Bye but don't go away and keep sending your emails to learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Bye! Hi, my name's Tom. At the end of every podcast, I talk about some of the language that you heard, and some ways to help you learn English. Today I want to talk about prepositions - words like 'on', 'at' and 'in'. It's very difficult for learners to use these words correctly in English. We use prepositions all the time - in lots of different ways. But today I'm only going to talk about one situation - using prepositions in time phrases - with words like 'Saturday', 'Christmas' or 'December'. Listen to Ravi. Which preposition does he use before 'Saturday'? Ravi Well, I wanted to ask you about that. What are you doing on Saturday? That's right - he uses 'on'. We say 'on Saturday' - or 'on' any other day of the week. 'On Sunday', 'on Monday', 'on Tuesday' - all of the days. Now listen to part of Gordon's joke. The man in the joke is trying to explain what a 'rose' is. Listen to the preposition with 'Valentine's Day'. Romantic - you give it to people you love on Valentine's Day. He said 'on Valentine's Day'. Valentine's Day isn't a day of the week, but it is a day - a single day. So we use 'on' again. Now listen to one more. This is Bill in Prague talking about the fish that they eat. Listen for the time phrase. Spending a few days in clean bath water cleans the carp and makes it taste better when it is eaten on Christmas Eve. Yes, it was 'on' again. He said \"on Christmas Eve\". Can you guess why? Christmas Eve is what we call the day before Christmas day - the 24th of December. So, Christmas Eve is a single day. So we use 'on'. So - when we're talking about a single day, we use 'on'. We can say \"on my birthday\" or \"on the first of December\" or \"on the day I met you\". And we use it for dates too - because they're single days - 'on the first of January', 'on the twenty-fifth of April', 'on the tenth of July'. There's just one more thing I need to tell you about using 'on' in time phrases. Listen to this line from Gordon's joke. What was the name of the Indian restaurant we went to last Saturday? Hmm. He said \"last Saturday\" - he didn't use 'on'. The reason is simple. We don't use a preposition when we use 'last'. We just say 'last Saturday'. No 'on'. And it's the same with 'next' and 'this. We just say \"What are you doing next Saturday?\" or \"Let's have dinner this Saturday\". No 'on'. So now you know how to use 'on' in time phrases! In other time phrases we might use 'at' or 'in' - for example we say \"at the weekend\" or \"at Christmas\", and we say \"in December\" or \"in the afternoon\". It's quite difficult to remember them all. But if you can remember that we use 'on' for single days, it will make life a lot easier for you! People often make mistakes with prepositions because they aren't thinking in English. They think in their own language and then translate the words into English. And that's when they make mistakes - and not only with prepositions - with lots of different things. When you're writing you have time to think - you can look at grammar books, or your notebook, for help. But speaking is different - you often don't have time to think. If you want to speak English well - you have to start trying to think in English. You can do this with practise. Look at things that you see around you - at home or in the street and say the words in English. You can say them out loud if you're alone - if not just think them. Then start trying to say or think sentences - 'I'm going to the kitchen now. I'm going to make my lunch'. Talk to yourself about what you're doing in English - out loud or in your head. Try to do this for a short time at first - then you can increase the time. Try to do it for an hour every day - it will soon get easier. And your brain will learn to think in English. Try it. I'm sure you'll notice the difference after a while. And now for something different. In this podcast we heard Carolina meeting some people in a pub. She learnt a new word. Listen. But is a round a drink? No. One person buys a drink for everyone at the table - that's called a round. Then next time someone else buys one. Henry bought the first one and now Jake's buying the next one, so it's his round. But you don't have to. not if you don't want to.if you don't want a drink or something. Pubs are a big part of British culture. British people often go to the pub, and you will often be invited to go too. This doesn't mean that you have to drink alcohol. You can drink lots of different things in a pub - and you can do a lot of different things too. You can have a meal for example. A lot of pubs serve very good food - at lunchtime or in the evening - and it's usually cheaper than eating in a restaurant. A lot of pubs have live music, or maybe karaoke evenings. Another popular thing is a pub quiz. Teams of people try to answer questions to win a prize. That's a good way to practise your English! So, it's good to know some phrases in English that you need to use in a pub. In this podcast Carolina learnt what 'to buy a round' means. Now listen to Jake. Can you understand all of the drinks that he's going to buy? Come up to the bar with me and we'll ask. You can give me a hand with the drinks. OK, so that's two bottles of Newcastle Brown, a pint of lager, a half of lager, a Diet Coke, a pineapple juice - and whatever Carolina wants. The word 'pint' is probably new for you. Jake is going to buy a pint of lager. 'A pint' is a British measurement - it's a little bit more than half a litre - point five seven of a litre in fact. We use it informally to mean a pint of beer. And 'a half' means half a pint of beer - so that's more or less a quarter of a litre. Now one more useful phrase. Listen. So, same again everybody? yes, yes please, yep, same again, same for me please You'll hear 'same again' a lot in the pub, especially when people are buying rounds. It means 'another of the same drink that you had before'. If someone says “What would you like to drink?” you can say ”Same again please”. Now, just before I go, I noticed a useful phrase that you can try and use this week. It's a phrase that means 'I'm sure'. Listen and see if you can hear it. Gordon. I bet you're often in the pub. Surrounded by people laughing at your jokes. That's right Ravi. The phrase is 'I bet'. We use it informally and it means 'I'm sure'. For example, we can say \"I bet it's going to rain tomorrow\" or \"I bet Ana forgot her homework again\". Try and use 'I bet' in your conversations in English. OK. That's all from me today. I'll talk to you all again on the next podcast. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! Or write to me about any interesting language that you noticed. In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Hello once again and welcome to the LearnEnglish Elementary podcast number 9 with me, Ravi, from Manchester. And me Tess, from London. And Gordon, our producer, from where are you from Gordon? Gordon_ Me? I'm from Keswick, in the Lake District, you know, but I've lived in London for about twenty years. Keswick? Really? I'm going there this weekend. Really? What for? Having a weekend away? Are you going cycling again? Yeah, we are, six of us. We're getting the train up from London on Friday morning then cycling to Keswick, spending a night there then we're going to do a really long ride on the Saturday.. You're not going to camp, are you? Isn't it a bit cold? No, we're not - it is a bit cold. We're staying in youth hostels, you know. Oh right, I haven't been in a youth hostel since I was a kid. Are they still really cold and uncomfortable? No, not at all. Some of them are fantastic. I mean, they're not like five star hotels or anything but they're really comfortable and you meet some really interesting people in them. Hmm. Sounds OK, better than I remember. It's the cycling I don't want to do. How far are you going to ride each day? About fifty miles or so. It depends. It's more difficult with all the hills and stuff. We haven't booked the youth hostels - they won't be really busy at this time of year. So we'll just stay at the nearest place if we get really tired. Ah OK. Sounds great. When are you coming back? We're getting a train on Sunday afternoon so we'll get back to London in the evening, about six o'clock, I think. Do you know what I'm going to do this weekend? No? What are you up to? Absolutely nothing. I'm going to sit on my sofa all weekend and watch TV. I've got loads of DVDs I want to watch. I'll think of you on your bicycle though. I don't know how you can do nothing all weekend Ravi. I'd get so bored. I know, I know. I'm going to start going to the gym soon, honest. I can never find the time. Anyway, it's time now to move on. As usual we're going to start with Would Like to Meet. In every podcast someone comes to the studio and tells us about a famous person - alive or dead - that they'd like to meet. We've got Sean here with us today so let's start by finding out something about you. Well, my name's Sean, I'm seventeen, and I'm from Brighton. That's where my mum and dad live. I go down there a lot. Great place. Yeah, it's good. There's plenty to do - good shops. I'd rather live in London though. I bet if you lived in London, you'd want to go back to Brighton. Get some fresh air, see the sea. Maybe - but then I could visit my mum and dad, like you do Ravi. Well that's true. Yeah, live in London, have family in Brighton - perfect really. And who are you going to talk about today Sean. Who's the famous person you'd like to meet? Matt Groening. The Simpsons guy? The Simpsons guy? I always thought it was pronounced 'groaning'. Well I did too, for a long time. But no it isn't, it rhymes with 'raining' - Matt Groening. OK, That's the name sorted out. Tell us a bit about him Sean. Well, as you know, he's the guy who created the Simpsons which is probably the best show on TV anywhere in the world. Ever. And a great film too. You're a fan then. Ever since I can remember. And I just think that the man who created something so brilliant must be a really funny guy. To be honest, I don't know much about him as a person - I know he's really old - he must be fifty or something - at least. I'm not sure fifty is really old Sean. My mother wouldn't be very happy to hear that. Well you know, whatever. He's older than my dad anyway. That's why I'd like to meet him - he must be really funny and really smart, but he's old. Um, what else do I know? Um - and I know he's got kids - two kids called Abraham and Homer. He called his son Homer! After Homer Simpson! Well maybe - maybe not. Homer was his dad's name too - he got all the names from his own family. His mum and dad were Homer and Margaret - Marge for short. And his little sisters are Lisa and Maggie. Bart was going to be called Matt at first but then he changed his mind. But I read somewhere that the character of Bart Simpson was based on his older brother. I guess I'd like to meet him too. When did the show start? In the 1980s - I'm not sure of the year. But it's about twenty years old. But the characters never get any older - I like that. Oh, and another thing I've just remembered - “Doh!” - you know Homer Simpsons' famous “Doh!” - is now in the Oxford English Dictionary. I think that's pretty amazing. And I can't remember anything else. Doh! Don't worry about it - that was really interesting Thanks Sean, another good one there. Ravi, I don't why I haven't asked you this before - who would you like to meet? Who would you talk about if you were our guest on the podcast? Oof. That's a tough one. There's so many. Matt Groening's a good one - I'd love to meet him. Peter Jackson who directed the Lord of the Rings films - he'd be really interesting. Erm J.K. Rowling who wrote the Harry Potter books. Yeah, maybe her - she seems quite an interesting character. Yeah, I'd like to meet her too. And remember, listeners, that we're always interested to hear about people that you'd like to meet. Or even cartoon characters! That's a good one! Which cartoon character would you like to meet and why. Brilliant idea! So send your thoughts to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org, that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - at britishcouncil - all one word dot org, that's o-r-g. Right. Shall we meet the players for our quiz today then? We have a little quiz now with two of our listeners and this time we've got Ethan. Hi Ethan. Hi Ravi And Abby. Hello Abby. Hi Ravi. Let's start with you, Abby. Where are you calling from? From Margate. Ah, at the seaside. Is it sunny down there today? It is, it's lovely and warm today. And what do you do Abby? I've just left school. I don't know what I'm going to do now. Well, good luck with what you decide to do and good luck with today's quiz. Now, Ethan. Hi Ravi. Where are you from, Ethan? South London. OK. Well I know that it's sunny here in London too. What do you do Ethan? Nothing, at the moment Ravi. I finished school last year and I'm going to university in a couple of months time. I've had a gap year and done some travelling. Ah, fantastic. Where have you been? I went to South America for 4 months. Brilliant. Did you have a good time? Unbelievable. It was so cool. Right. Today's quiz is another ten second quiz, OK? I'm going to give you a topic and you've got ten seconds to think of as many things as you can. So, let's say, I say 'things that you play' you have to think of as many things as you can. You might say 'football', 'the piano', 'volleyball', you know. All things that you play. The winner is the person who gets the most in ten seconds, OK? OK then. You've got ten seconds to write down things that you make. I'll give you one to start with - 'make the bed'. Go on then, ten seconds, things that you make. Go! OK - time's up. How many Abby? Five OK. How about you Ethan? Erm.. six, Ravi. OK then, let's hear your six Ethan. Erm.. Make a decision, make a mistake, make a mess, make friends, make progress and make an appointment. Yep. That's six. Well done. It's not easy when the clock's ticking. So, you win the book token Ethan, we'll send that to you soon - and bad luck to you Abby but thank you for playing. And remember everyone that if you've got a brilliant idea for a game we can play then you can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org Now though, it's time for Our Person In - the part of the podcast when we hear from different people around the world telling us something interesting about where they live. This time round Bridget Keenan is Our Woman in India. India is a nation of cinema-lovers - almost 40 million people go to the cinema each month and India produces almost twice as many films each year as the USA. The Indian film industry is known as Bollywood and you never feel like you are far from its influence. In cities, giant hand-painted images of Bollywood stars look down at the passing traffic and in parts of India film stars have used their popularity to start careers as politicians. Bollywood films are quite different to Hollywood films. Although the plots can be similar, the Indian films feature a lot more singing and dancing - there are usually six songs and at least two huge dance scenes. In fact, the stories are often very predictable and always have a happy ending - but that doesn't stop people going to see them. And going to see films is a special experience too - much noisier and livelier than British cinemas. The crowd will cheer on the hero through all the action scenes, whistle through the songs and offer advice and support throughout the film. The audience can be as much fun as the film. That audience seems to be almost everyone in India - from the very old to the very young. In the countryside there are touring cinemas - a lorry travelling with all the equipment to make a temporary cinema in a village for one night before moving on to the next place. It's a love of cinema shared by the whole, huge country unlike anywhere else in the world. Hehe. That brings back some memories. We used to watch loads of Bollywood films when I was a kid. They're great fun. Did you? Do you still watch them now? Not really. If I'm at my mum and dad's I might. My mum still watches them quite a lot. I've never seen a Bollywood film. They sound very different. I'll lend you a DVD. I'll give you the address again if you'd like to tell us something about going to the cinema in your country. It's learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. And that takes us into Your Turn - the part of the show where we ask you what you think. I told you earlier that I'm going away for the weekend, cycling. That's a perfect holiday for me and that's what we asked people for Your Turn - What's your perfect holiday. Let's hear what they said. Ooh what a lovely idea, I love holidays. The beach for me. Sitting in the sun, with a cold drink and doing absolutely nothing. That would be perfect. Bah, my next holiday seems ages away. Hmm. I just get really bored sitting on a beach all day with all that sand getting everywhere. I'd rather be in the countryside - or just somewhere where there aren't any crowds. The beach is always so crowded. What I really like about a holiday is when I don't have any plan, y'know? I like travelling about and if I like somewhere I stay there for a few days and if I don't I just get on a train and go somewhere different. That's what I really like - when I don't have to worry about timetables and all that stuff. I would really love to go on a cruise. Y'know? A holiday on a boat where you travel to different cities. My aunt and uncle went on one last year and said it was great. Everything's planned for you so you don't have to worry about anything at all. Lovely. My perfect holiday would be a trip to China. I've always wanted to go there. It just seems so fascinating - so different, y'know. And there'd be so much to see. I'd love to tour the whole country - but I guess that would take years. Ravi? Your perfect holiday? I really want to go to Australia. A couple of my friends went there last year and said it was brilliant. Yeah, I really like the sound of Australia too. Let us know what your perfect holiday would be. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. Now let's join Carolina again. Carolina is a student from Venezuela who's come to Britain to live, study - and have fun. She's really settled in in Newcastle. Last time we listened she was in the pub with her friends from the Conservation Society. This time, Carolina is preparing a special meal for her friends. In the shared kitchen Hi. How's it going? Everything under control? Oh - I'm beginning to panic a bit. The rice and beans are done, they're cooking now, that's for Jamie - he's vegetarian. I need to grill the meat - and I need to make the guasacaca - oh dear, and I wanted to have a shower - I'm so hot. What time are they coming? I told them eight o'clock. I hope they're late! Don't panic. You've got plenty of time. What can I do to help? What's gwuh.. whatever it was? Guasacaca. It's like a salad sort of thing, with avocadoes and herbs. It goes with the meat. Well, why don't you tell me what to do and I'll make it while you have a shower. OK thanks. You're an angel. Um, you need an onion, some green pepper, some red pepper, some garlic, um some parsley - and you chop it all up - in quite small pieces and put everything in a bowl. It's all here look. OK. I'll start chopping. How much garlic? Um, three of those what do you call them? The small parts of garlic. Cloves? You mean cloves. Three of these? Yes that's right. Then what? Then you put it in a bowl with olive oil, vinegar, a little sugar and some chilli powder. Oh and some salt. And what about the avocado? You add that at the end. There are two avocadoes in the fridge. You mash one, you know, with a fork so it's like a paste, and the other one you just chop, so it's in pieces. I think I can manage that. And then I add the avocadoes to the stuff in the bowl? Yes. And put it in the fridge. Right. No problem. You go and make yourself look beautiful. Hi. Here we are Oh hi. Hi Henry. Hi. Hi Emily. Hi. Did you find it OK? Yeah, it was easy. We've brought a bottle of wine - it's white, it probably needs to go in the fridge. And we brought these too, for you. Oh that's very kind of you. I love chocolate. Thanks. Can we put our coats somewhere? You can put them in my room. Here, I'll take them. Well, sit down. Make yourselves at home Thanks. It's a nice place you've got here. Great kitchen. Really big. Thanks. Yes, we're very lucky. Now what would you all like to drink? We've got. So, here it is. Just help yourselves. It looks delicious. I hope so. Mmm, this is good. What's in it? Rice and black beans, and um onion and pepper - and some spices Delicious. Is this a traditional Venezuelan dinner then? Well, in Venezuela we usually eat a big meal for lunch, and have a smaller meal in the evening. But yes, it's a traditional meal, nearly. We should have fried I don't know the word - they're like bananas - big, hard bananas. Plantains? They look like bananas. Yes, maybe, plantains. Anyway, I couldn't find any, but everything else is traditional. Hey, we forgot the music! Henry, do you want to come and choose something? I'll show you where the CDs are. Sure. My rooms just through here on the Well. Here we are then. Just the two of us. Awww. What? Oh nothing Ravi. I really want to know what's going to happen next. To Carolina? And Jamie. Never mind. Right. It's time for Gordon. Are you ready there Gordon? Ready. Tess: For new listeners, Gordon tells us a joke every week. If you like bad jokes, you'll love Gordon. Thanks Tess. Right - I've got a parrot for you this week. Another parrot? Yes - a parrot and a magician. A magician who worked on a cruise ship - you know, the big ships that people have holidays on - had a parrot. But the parrot had seen the magician's act hundreds of times and knew all the tricks. So whenever the magician did his act the parrot just sat there looking really bored because he'd worked out how the magician made things disappear. Anyway, one night, during the magician's show, the ship hit an iceberg and sank. The only survivors were the magician and the parrot. The magician managed to climb into a lifeboat and immediately fell into a deep deep sleep. A little bit after that the parrot came and sat on the edge of the lifeboat and stared at the magician. The magician slept for three days and the parrot didn't take his eyes off him. It just stared and stared and stared. Finally, the magician opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was the parrot - watching him like a well, like a parrot. Another hour went past and the parrot didn't take his eyes off the magician. Then the parrot opened its beak and squawked “Alright. I give up. What did you do with the ship?” No, that's terrible Gordon. I still prefer the jokes about dogs. Actually, maybe some of our listeners could send you some new jokes. The address for jokes or anything else you want to send to us is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. We have to go now but in a moment you can listen to Tom, our English teacher, who'll be talking about some of the language you heard in this podcast and things to help you learn. So, stick around to listen to Tom but we'll say goodbye for now. Bye! Hello again. My name's Tom. And at the end of every podcast, I talk about some of the language that you heard, and some ways to help you learn English. Today I want to talk about the verbs 'make' and 'do'. This is a big problem for learners of English. A lot of languages only have one word for 'make' and 'do'. For example, in Portuguese, the verb 'fazer' is sometimes 'make' in English, and sometimes it's 'do'. So it can be very difficult for Portuguese learners to know when to use 'make' and when to use 'do'. So what's the difference between them? Well, it isn't an easy question to answer. Most of the time there isn't really any difference in meaning at all. It's just that in some phrases we use 'make' and in other phrases we use 'do'. Some grammar books tell you that we use 'make' when we are creating something - something that we can touch. This is sometimes true. Listen to Carolina talking about the guasacaca. Which verb does she use? I need to grill the meat - and I need to make the guasacaca - oh dear, and I wanted to have a shower - I'm so hot. She says 'I need to make the guasacaca'. We often use 'make' when we're talking about food - dishes that we've created from other things. We don't 'make' meat - that comes from an animal already made! - we just cook it. Now listen to Emily offering to help with the guasacaca. Well, why don't you tell me what to do and I'll make it while you have a shower. Emily uses 'make' too. She's going to make the guasacaca for Carolina. So try to remember this use of 'make' with food. You can say to your friend “Mmm, this soup is delicious! You must tell me how to make it”. Or “This cake is very good. Did you make it yourself?”. But there are lots of other phrases with 'make'. The quiz in this podcast was about things that you can 'make'. Listen to the last part. OK then, let's hear your six Ethan. Erm.. Make a decision, make a mistake, make a mess, make friends, make progress and make an appointment. Ethan gives six examples of phrases with 'make'. • You make the bed when you get up in the morning, • you can make an important decision, • you can make a mistake - not 'do' - we don't say 'do a mistake'. • You can make a mess - if you drop things all over the floor for example, • you can make friends, just like Carolina has in Newcastle, and • you can make an appointment to see the doctor or the dentist. We always use 'make' in these phrases. There's no reason for using 'make' - it isn't because of the meaning of the phrases. It's just what we say. It's a good idea to keep a page in your notebook for phrases with 'make' and 'do' - and try to learn them. Start with the ones from this podcast and then add to them when you find more. Here are two phrases with 'do' that you can add too. We say 'do your homework' - 'do' not 'make'. Say “I'm sorry I didn't do the homework” to your teacher. And we also say 'do an exam' or 'do a test'. Never 'make'. OK. Now for something different. I noticed a phrase in this podcast that might be useful for you to understand. Listen to Ravi talking to Ethan in the quiz. What did Ethan do after he left school? What do you do Ethan? Nothing, at the moment Ravi. I finished school last year and I'm going to university in a couple of months time. I've had a gap year and done some travelling. Ethan had a gap-year after he finished school. It means that he didn't start university immediately after he finished school. He waited for a year. Lots of British students have gap-years. Sometimes they work for a few months to get some money and then they go travelling - to see the world. Sometimes they go and do voluntary work for a year. The universities are usually very happy about this. They think it gives the students experience of the real world before they start studying hard again. So now you know what a 'gap-year' is if you hear anyone say it. Now I want you to listen to Carolina again. Carolina speaks very good English - but sometimes there are words that she doesn't know. Listen to what she says when she doesn't know the word. OK. I'll start chopping. How much garlic? Um, three of those what do you call them? The small parts of garlic. Cloves? You mean cloves. Three of these? Yes that's right. OK - she asks Emily “what do you call them?” - she asks Emily. But she also tries to describe the thing that she doesn't know. She says “the small parts of garlic”. This is very important when you don't know a word. Don't just stop! Try to describe what you want to say. Listen to Carolina again. But yes, it's a traditional meal, nearly. We should have fried. I don't know the word - they're like bananas - big, hard bananas. Plantains? They look like bananas. Yes, maybe, plantains. She doesn't know the word 'plantains' so she says “They're like bananas - big hard bananas”. And Henry understands what she wants to say. Try to do the same thing when you don't know a word. Don't stop - keep talking. Use different words to describe what you want to say. people will understand and give you the word that you need. Before I go, as usual, I want to give you a useful phrase from the podcast - a phrase for you to use. Listen to what Carolina says to Jamie and Henry. Well, sit down. Make yourselves at home. Yes, it's another phrase with 'make'. She says “Make yourselves at home”. She wants them to be relaxed and comfortable - as if they were in their own homes. 'Yourselves' is plural - Carolina is speaking to two people. If you're talking to one person then you say “Make yourself at home”. So try to use the phrase when someone comes to visit you in your house. Say “Make yourself at home”. OK. That's all from me today. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! Or write to me about any interesting language that you noticed. In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. So bye for now!\n",
            "Hello. I'm Ravi - and I want to say welcome to a special Learn English elementary podcast number ten. This is the last podcast in the first series {pause} so today we're going to do something a bit different. We've had lots of emails from you, the listeners, and lots of great comments on the site, saying how much you've enjoyed all of the podcasts in this series. So Gordon, our producer, has put together some of your favourite parts from the first nine podcasts for you to hear again - or maybe for you to hear for the first time. Any way, listen again, or for the first time, and we hope you enjoy it! Especially for any new listeners out there, our first section is from podcast one - and it's the part when you get to meet me, Tess and Gordon. Hello, and welcome to LearnEnglish elementary podcast number one. My name's Ravi and I'm Tess. We're your presenters and we've got lots of things for you to listen to today, but before we start, I think we should introduce ourselves. Ravi? OK erm I'm Ravi or, I tell you what, I'll introduce you and you can introduce me. How about that? Well, OK then. Erm, this is Tess. She's from London. She's how old are you? None of your business, Ravi! i and she loves dancing and riding her mountain bike. OK? OK. And this is Ravi. He comes from Manchester. He's 23. Oh, aren't you? Oh yes. He likes football - and he's a great cook. Thanks! And there's one more person for you to meet. I'd like to introduce our producer, Gordon. Say hello to everyone Gordon! Hello! Pleased to meet you! And how are you today? Very well thank you Tess. Good! We'll speak to Gordon again later in the show but now it's time to get on with our programme. Right, so that's us. The next section is 'I'd like to meet', when we talk to people about a famous person that they'd like to meet. A lot of you thought that this one was very interesting. It's from podcast number seven - and it's Muhammed from Manchester, talking about a very important man. So let's say hello to this week's guest, Muhammed from Manchester. Hi Muhammed. Welcome to 'I'd like to meet'. Hi Tess and Ravi Hi Muhammed. So you're a Manchester boy like me. Good football team eh. Which one? Which one!? No - don't tell me you're a Manchester City supporter! Noooo! I'm afraid so. Sorry Ravi. Ravi can't speak - so I'll continue. What do you do Muhammed? I'm at college at the moment - but when I finish I want to join the police. You want to be a policeman. What made you decide to do that? My uncle's a policeman. I don't know really - it's just something I've always wanted to do. OK. Now, who are you going to talk about today Muhammed - who's the person that you'd like to meet - if you had the chance? I want to talk about Muhammed Yunus. OK. Off you go. Well, he's from Bangladesh - from Chittagong actually - that's where my dad's family came from - we've still got relations living there. And I think everyone knows his name now - since he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 - well he won it with his bank. A bank won the Nobel peace prize? Yes. The Grameen Bank? Microcredit? Well, yeah, it sounds familiar. It's a bank for poor people. Perhaps you'd better explain how it works Muhammed. Well, it all started when he - Dr Yunus - he's a professor of economics - he visited a village outside Chittagong, and he talked to a very poor woman - and he realised that she only needed a small amount of money - just a couple of dollars - and then she could buy materials to make things and sell them and earn money. She couldn't borrow money from the bank because they didn't believe that she would pay it back. He found more people in the same situation - think it was forty-two people in the village - and all of them together only needed twenty-seven dollars -- that's all they needed to be able to start making money for themselves. So he lent them the money - and they all paid it back to him later. Then he went to other villages and did the same thing. So he started his own bank - the Grameen Bank - to lend small amounts of money to poor people, mostly women actually. That's what microcredit means. What kinds of things do they use the money for? Well, a woman can buy a cow, and then she can sell the milk and pay to send her children to school. Or she could buy a mobile phone - the villages don't have telephones - and then people can pay to use her phone. They aren't expensive things - it just means that poor people can start to earn money. And now the Grameen Bank lends millions and millions of dollars to people. And they all pay it back? Most of them yes - something like 99 per cent. And now countries like the United States and Britain are using the idea too, it's all over the world - so - well, I think he's brilliant - a real hero. That's what I'd like to say to him. Well thank you Muhammed. That was really interesting. Thanks. There's an old joke isn't there - something about 'a bank will only lend you money if you can prove that you don't need it'. Well yes - it's true isn't it! I'd never really thought about it before. No, nor me. So that was Muhammed talking about Muhammed Yunus. I learnt some interesting things that day. {pause} And now the quiz. We've played lots of different games in the quiz section - words beginning with letters of the alphabet, things that are different colours, - but this game is one of your favourites. Hot Seat. And this one's from podcast number four. Every week we have a little quiz to make you think. This week we're going to play Hot Seat again. Here to play are Hannah and Max. Hi Hannah. Hello Hi Max Hello. You're both from Sheffield, is that right? Yeah And how old are you? I'm seventeen And I'm sixteen. We go to the same school. St Joseph's. Are you in the same class? We are, yeah. OK. And who's doing what? Who's going to explain the words and who's going to be in the Hot Seat? I'll explain and Max'll guess. OK. OK, Max? OK. Right. Remember how to play? These cards have all got words on. Hannah has to explain the words and Max has to guess them. But remember Hannah, you can't use the words on the card. Max, you have to guess as many words as you can in one minute. OK? OK Then let's go. You've got one minute starting now! Erm.. big thing. On the sea. You sail in it. Boat? Ship. Ship! An animal. Small. Big ears. Elephant. No. It's small. Carrots! It eats carrots. Rabbit. Yes, yes! Erm.. you do it at the disco. Dance. Yes! It's a fruit I think. It's very hard. It's got milk inside. You can eat part of it but not the outside. Coconut! Yes! Erm, you go there when you're sick. Hospital. Doctor's. Hospital. It's white. Comes from a cow. You drink it. Milk. It goes across the river. You cross it. A bridge You stand under it in the morning and you wash yourself. Shower! It's a day. Erm you'll be eighteen Birthday. We'll give you 'birthday'. Fantastic. How many was that? I make it nine. Is that right? Yes, nine. Brilliant. Well done Hannah and Max! Yes, well done Hannah and Max. {pause} And now the next thing we've got for you is 'Our person in..'. when people around the world tell us something interesting about where they live. And this time it's something that I do know about - the Indian film industry. Bridget Keenan lives in India and she's talking about Bollywood - and it comes from podcast number nine. India is a nation of cinema-lovers - almost 40 million people go to the cinema each month and India produces almost twice as many films each year as the USA. The Indian film industry is known as Bollywood and you never feel like you are far from its influence. In cities, giant hand-painted images of Bollywood stars look down at the passing traffic and in parts of India film stars have used their popularity to start careers as politicians. Bollywood films are quite different to Hollywood films. Although the plots can be similar, the Indian films feature a lot more singing and dancing - there are usually six songs and at least two huge dance scenes. In fact, the stories are often very predictable and always have a happy ending - but that doesn't stop people going to see them. And going to see films is a special experience too - much noisier and livelier than British cinemas. The crowd will cheer on the hero through all the action scenes, whistle through the songs and offer advice and support throughout the film. The audience can be as much fun as the film. That audience seems to be almost everyone in India - from the very old to the very young. In the countryside there are touring cinemas - a lorry travelling with all the equipment to make a temporary cinema in a village for one night before moving on to the next place. It's a love of cinema shared by the whole, huge country unlike anywhere else in the world. Hehe. That brings back some memories. We used to watch loads of Bollywood films when I was a kid. They're great fun. Did you? Do you still watch them now? Not really. If I'm at my mum and dad's I might. My mum still watches them quite a lot. I've never seen a Bollywood film. They sound very different. I'll lend you a DVD. And that's reminded me - I never did lend Tess that Bollywood DVD. Something to remember next time I see her. Now, a lot of you enjoy the next section - 'Your turn'. And a lot of you wrote to us to tell us what you think about all the questions that we talked about in this series. But now, let's listen to 'Your turn' from podcast number six. Now it's time for Your Turn. Your Turn is when we go out in the street to find out what people think. This time the question was.. \"How green are you?\" Nice one. “How green are you?” - what do you do to help save the planet? Like use public transport. OK. Let's hear what people said. What do I do to help save the planet? Not enough. I hate to say it, but it's true, I mean, I always try to remember not to use plastic bags or recycle or whatever but I always forget. I really have to try to do more. Well, we recycle pretty much everything we can, you know, bottles, cans, newspapers and all that but to be honest we don't do much else. I do as much as I can. You have to, you know? We all have to. I don't take short-haul flights anymore - I used to fly down to London quite a lot - and of course I recycle and everything else I can. I know I'm not going to make myself popular saying this but I don't really do very much. Look - there are factories all over the world putting out loads and loads of pollution every single day and I don't see how saving your old newspapers is going to help apart from making people feel good about themselves. I'll tell you the greenest thing I do - I grow almost all my own vegetables. I've really started thinking about where my food comes from and the food miles and that - you know, like I won't buy food that's been flown here from Australia or something. They make me feel a bit guilty. Some people do so much. I feel like the first woman who said she didn't do enough. I don't think I do enough. I do recycle things though. Me too. It's difficult though, isn't it? Anyway, remember, listeners, that we'd love to know what you think. How green are you? What do you do to help save the planet? You can write and tell us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. An interesting question. And don't forget, it isn't too late for you to send us your opinion about this, or any of the other 'Your turn' questions in series one. We always enjoy hearing from you. {pause} Now for my favourite part of the podcast - the adventures of Carolina. A lot of you said that you liked this one the best. Carolina makes a mistake with her English - and it's from podcast number seven. OK. Time now to find out how Carolina's getting on in Newcastle. Carolina, you might remember, is a student from Venezuela who's come to Britain to live, study and have fun. Last time we listened, Carolina joined some societies at the university but this time she's not feeling too well. Hi Emily. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you had a seminar at 10 o'clock. I did, but I'm not feeling very well. Bless you! You sound terrible. You'd better go to bed. Did you tell your tutor that you were ill? No, I was early, he wasn't there, but I left a note on the door. I said I was sorry, but I was very constipated. Constipated? Why did you tell him you were constipated? Well, because I am. See, I can't stop sneezing. You don't sneeze when you're constipated. Constipated means that you can't go to the toilet, you know, you're blocked.., you know, you try and try but you can't. well you know. Oh no! I was thinking in Spanish! In Spanish we say I'm constipada! Well in English it's a cold. You say I've got a cold - a bad cold. I knew that! I've got a cold! What a stupid mistake! It's because I'm ill - my head feels like it's full of, I don't know, .. cake. Cake?! And I left a note on the door. Everyone's going to laugh at me. No they won't. Don't be silly. Everyone knows English isn't your first language - you made a mistake that's all. But they won't know it's a mistake. They'll think I wanted to tell everyone that I was constipated, that I couldn't go to the toilet. Oh, I want to go home to Venezuela. Look, it's not ten o'clock yet. I'll go the room and take the note off the door and explain to. who? Professor Grogan. Room 102. It'll be too late. And you can go to the chemist's and get yourself something to take. Then come back here and go to bed. You look awful. Have some hot lemon and honey - that's what my mother always gives me. OK, thanks a lot Emily. Good morning. Can I help you? Yes please. I can't stop sneezing. Have you got anything I can take? Is it a cold or an allergy? It's a cold. I don't have any allergies, at least I don't think so. Have you got any other symptoms? A sore throat? A headache? A cough? Yes, my throat hurts - it hurts when I eat or drink, and my head hurts too. Have you got a temperature? A temperature? What's that? I'm sorry, my English is terrible today. You know, have you got a high temperature, do you feel hot? Is your face hot? You mean a fever? Yes, yes, I think so, my face is hot but my body feels cold. OK. It sounds like a bad cold. Let's see... this should help. Are you allergic to any medicines? No, no I'm not. How often do I have to take it? Two spoonfuls, four times a day. The instructions are on the bottle. Don't take it if you're driving, it might make you sleepy. That's OK. I just want to go to bed. Should I take anything else? Vitamin C will help. Here you are. Take one of these three times a day. And drink plenty of water. Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking? Venezuela. I've only been here a few weeks. Ah. Venezuela. I expect our English weather is a bit too cold for you then. Spend the rest of the day in bed and keep warm. You'll feel a lot better tomorrow. I hope so. If you still feel terrible in two or three days then you should go and see a doctor. Thank you very much. And how much is that for the medicines? Poor Carolina. It's terrible when you feel ill in a foreign country. \"I am constipated.\" Oh, stop it Ravi. Yeah, you're right. It is quite funny though. And she got some medicine so I'm sure she's OK. Ah, 'I'm constipated'. I thought that was really funny when I first heard it. And it still makes me laugh now. Poor Carolina - her English is usually so good. And talking about funny - at the end of every podcast, Gordon, our producer, tells a joke. Sometimes good, sometimes - well, terrible. But a lot of you wrote to tell us that you really liked Gordon's jokes. And there were two favourites. So let's listen to them both. This one comes from podcast number one. Come on Gordon! Are you ready? I'm ready. I hope this is good Gordon. How long have I got? One minute - at the most. OK then. Right. A chicken walks into a library A chicken? Yeah. A chicken walks into a library, walks up to the counter and says to the librarian “Book, book”. The librarian gives the chicken 2 books - she puts the books on the chicken's head - and the chicken walks out of the library. One hour later, the chicken walks back into the library. It walks up to the counter and says to the librarian “Book, book” . The librarian gives the chicken 2 books and the chicken walks out of the library. An hour later, this happens again. “Book, book”, and the chicken walks out of the library with 2 books on its head. But this time the librarian thinks, “Hmm, this is strange” so she decides to follow the chicken. She goes out of the library and follows the chicken. The chicken crosses the road, walks along the street, turns the corner, until it comes to the lake. Sitting by the lake is a big, fat frog. The chicken gives the books to the frog and the frog looks at them and says “Read it, Read it”. Oh Gordon, that's terrible. Don't worry about Tess - she always says Gordon's jokes are terrible. And here's your other favourite. It's from podcast number two. OK then Gordon, let's hear your joke for today. OK. It's a camping joke. Tess, you'll love it. Come on then. Well, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are on a camping trip in the countryside. Late at night, Holmes and Watson are lying on their backs looking up at all the stars in the sky. Sherlock Holmes says, “Doctor Watson, look at the stars and tell me what important question we have to ask.” Doctor Watson says, “Well, OK. There are millions and millions of stars in the sky. No-one knows exactly how many. There are planets out there that no-one has seen with a telescope. Maybe there is a planet somewhere that is just like earth. I think the question we have to ask is, “Is there life in another part of our universe?” And Sherlock Holmes says, “Watson, you idiot! The question we have to ask is “WHERE IS OUR TENT?” That's quite good, actually Gordon. Not bad. I think that's my favourite actually. And I hope you liked it too. {pause} Well, that's all for today. Usually, Tom the teacher comes along to talk about the language that you've heard in the podcasts, but this podcast is a little bit different. I hope you've enjoyed our Learn English elementary podcast 'greatest hits' and I hope you'll go back and listen to more of them again. You can go to the 'previous podcasts' section on the website and listen to any of them - and you can hear Tom the teacher's comments and advice there. So that's all from me! See you next time, in series two. Bye!\n",

            "Hi, Anna. Do you have a minute to talk about the meeting next Tuesday? Sure. We said 11, didn't we? Yeah, we did. But I have a bit of a problem with the time. Would it be possible to move it? Oh, I see. We could postpone it to the afternoon, to 1 p.m., for example. Or bring it forward to earlier in the morning. What would suit you? Could we make it 9 o'clock? That would really help me. I have another important meeting in the central office at 12. No problem. It's important you're there. Thanks a lot, Anna. Do you need help with any preparation? Did you get the agenda I sent out? Yes, I did. And no, that's all fine, thanks. My report is ready and I'm looking forward to presenting it. Great. I can tell Sven about the time change. I'll see him later. Don't worry about telling Sven. I'll send an email to everyone to confirm the time has changed and with an updated meeting invite. Great. Thanks, Anna. OK. I'm happy that works for you. We really need you there and it's good we don't have to cancel it. See you then. Have a good weekend in the meantime. You too.\n",
            "Sachi? Sachi? Sachiko! Francesco! Is everything OK? Yes. Yes. Sorry, I saw you and I was across the street I ran. I see. What's up? Do you have the tickets for the play? No, I don't.

            "and the next part of this talk is on the Panama Canal. It's amazing how this one small section of a small country can be so important to the world. Let's learn a little bit about the canal itself, before we look at how it connects to everything else. The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway in the Central American country of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. It is only 82 kilometres long. If you go around South America by ship then you need to travel another 15,000 kilometres. So the canal saves a lot of travel time. It takes around 8 to 10 hours to cross the canal. The French started building the canal in 1881, but they couldn't finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States and the canal was finally finished in 1914. Many people died while they were building the canal, some say up to 25,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the United States controlled the canal, but gave control back to Panama in 2000. Every year, around 40,000 ships come through the canal. These are mostly commercial ships. They transport goods for trade between Asia and America, or Europe. In 2016 the government of Panama made the canal bigger, so that now 99 per cent of ships can pass through it. Let's now turn to the role of the Panama Canal in the global economy\n",
            "How did it go? Umm, I think it went quite well. I did a lot of research and prepared a lot. I was in there for... I don't know... half an hour? And? What did they say? Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.' Really? Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the only interview that day, you know? Well, good luck with it. Anyway, you were saying... Oh, yeah, um... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but I couldn't look at it. Why not? Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it! Oh, right. Yes! And selfies. Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there? Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel? I know. And we never look at the photos after. Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things. Who took this? I can't remember. Hmmm... What am I doing? You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes! Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though. I know. Look at my hair - it was so long! Mine too, look at me! Hey I think I know who took this photo. Umm who? Was it Dad? No, it wasn't Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry? No. Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you...' Stop it! He was nice. Yeah, well, he took the photo. Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say. What? Well, you're not in our group - for the class project. What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you. I know. It's just that this time this time we made the group differently and because you were late... I see. You don't want me in the group? No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already. So? We can't be a group of five? Well, the teacher said four people per group. Oh. It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's... errrr... well, we already have the group. So I have to find another group. I'm sorry.\n",

            "I want to explain a few things about your essay. First of all, the deadline. The deadline for this essay is October the 18th. Not the 19th, not the 28th, not two days later because your dog was ill or your computer broke - the 18th. If it's late, I won't mark it. I won't even read it - you'll fail the assignment! So, please hand it in on time. You can even hand it in early, if you like! You can email me the essays at j.hartshorn@lmu.ac.uk. That's H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N. I'll reply to say I've got it. If I don't reply within a day, it might mean I didn't get it, so please email me again to make sure. You can also bring a paper copy of the essay to my office, but let's be kind to the trees, OK? Email is better for the trees and for me. Don't forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn't your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them! And lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers. Any questions?\n",

            "Hello, and welcome to LearnEnglish elementary podcast number one. My name's Ravi and I'm Tess. We're your presenters and we've got lots of things for you to listen to today, but before we start, I think we should introduce ourselves. Ravi? OK erm I'm Ravi. Or, I tell you what, I'll introduce you and you can introduce me. How about that? Well, OK then. Erm, this is Tess. She's from London. She's how old are you? None of your business, Ravi! And she loves dancing and riding her mountain bike. OK? OK. And this is Ravi. He comes from Manchester. He's 23. Oh aren't you? Oh yes. He likes football, and he's a great cook. Thanks! And there's one more person for you to meet. I'd like to introduce our producer, Gordon. Say hello to everyone Gordon! Hello! Pleased to meet you! Hi Gordon And how are you today? Very well thank you Tess. I'd like to meet Good! We'll speak to Gordon again later in the show but now it's time to get on with our programme. We've got an excellent show for you today, and let's start with our first section, called 'I'd like to meet'. We ask people a simple question - which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? And of course, we ask them to explain why. Our guest today on 'I'd like to meet' is Zara Heller from Bristol. Hello Zara and welcome to the show. Hello. Hi Zara. And what do you do Zara? I'm a student, I'm in my last year at school, I'm 16. Right. Now let's ask the question. So Zara, which famous person, dead or alive would you like to meet? I'd like to meet Angelina Jolie. Angelina Jolie. Great - good choice! Tell us a bit about her. She's an American film actress, she was in 'Tomb Raider', and she's an ambassador for the United Nations too. And why did you choose her to talk about today? Well, because I really admire her. She's a famous film star with a lot of money and a famous celebrity film star husband, but she really cares about helping people and she uses her money and her fame to help children and people who are very poor or have a difficult life. I saw a film about her on MTV the music channel - it was a video diary of her visiting Africa and talking about how to stop poverty, and they were really simple things, and I thought it was really cool because MTV doesn't usually show programmes like that, it's usually just music videos and things, but because she's famous and beautiful then people want to see her so she can get a lot of attention for the things that she wants to change. Do you like her films? Do you think she's a good actress? Yes I do. I don't think she's a great actress, but she's a good actress, and she's so beautiful that you just want to look at her all the time. Yeah. I think she's one of the most beautiful women in the world. I love watching her, I love all her films. And what would you like to talk to her about Zara? I'd like to talk about her trips to different places all around the world, and about Hollywood, and her family and about what people like me can do to help poor children. Well thank you very much Zara. That was really interesting. Personally, I'd like to talk to her about her husband, Brad Pitt. I think he's gorgeous. OK Tess, calm down. Erm, for all of you listening, we'd like to hear from you. Which famous person, dead or alive, would you like to meet? And why? Email us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org, that's learnenglishpodcast - all one word - AT - britishcouncil - all one word DOT org, that's o-r-g. Let us know which famous person you would like to meet and why. Quiz OK. Now it's quiz time. Every week we'll have a little quiz to get you thinking. This week it's the ten second quiz. It's very easy. We give you a topic and you give as many answers as you can - in 10 seconds. Our two players today are Daniel - Daniel's 16 and comes from London. Hello Daniel. Hi And Alice - Alice is also 16 and she comes from Liverpool. Hi Alice. Hello Do you both know what to do? OK. We give you a topic, and you have to write down all the words you can think of. For example, we say 'bathroom', and you write a list, bath, soap, shampoo, and so on. As quick as you can. Got the idea? Yeah Good. Okay. Let's play. You've got ten seconds to write down things you can find in a kitchen. OK? So, for example you could say 'microwave oven'. OK? Things you can find in a kitchen. Go! OK, Daniel. How many? Erm, five, Tess. How about you, Alice? Erm, seven, I think. OK, let's hear your seven words, Alice. Things you find in a kitchen. Erm, fridge. Cooker. Pans. Plates. Knife, fork, spoon. That's seven. Well done, Alice. How many did you get, Ravi? Oh, the clock makes me nervous - I can't think when the clock's ticking like that. Maybe the question next week will be about football. Thanks Daniel, thanks Alice. And if any of you listening have a good game we can play in quiz time, write to us and let us know. The address is learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. We'd love to hear your ideas for games we can play. What's next, Ravi? Our person in... The next part of the show is called 'Our person in'. We'll listen to people in interesting places all over the world telling us something about life in the country they're in. Today, we'll hear from Mike Southern. Mike is Our man in New York. New York. What do you think of? Skyscrapers. Taxis. Noise. People. John Lennon said that New York is the capital city of the world - and it certainly feels that way. But in the centre of this exciting, noisy, polluted city there is a place to find peace and quiet. A short walk from busy Fifth Avenue in Manhattan you'll find Central Park. Central Park is the green heart of New York City and over 25 million people come here each year to escape the city. People run, swim, climb or simply sit and read a book in the huge park's different scenery. And it's not just for people. Lots of rare birds have made their home in the park and there are legends of big cats hiding in the dark trees. Although it looks completely natural, the park is man made, created over 150 years ago. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux designed the park at a time when the city was a very crowded, dirty and unhealthy place to live. They wanted to make a place where rich and poor people could find fresh air in the dirty city. It does the same job today. As a friend of mine always tells me, “Life in New York would be impossible without Central Park” Wow! Really interesting. We'll hear from another one of our people next time. Or if you'd like to write in and tell us something interesting about your city or town, we'd love to hear from you. You can send it to us at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org Your turn Now we're going out into the street to listen to 'Your Turn' In this part of the show, we go out into the street to find out what people think about our question of the day. And today we're going to ask a question about celebrities - like film stars, actors, singers - who promote charities and ask people to give them money or aid. At the beginning of the show, we listened to Zara from Bristol talking about Angelina Jolie. Zara talked about Angelina Jolie's work for charity. And nowadays, lots of famous people - celebrities - do the same. But is it a good idea? So today's question is 'Is it a good idea for celebrities to do work for charity?' Hmm. 'Is it a good idea for celebrities to do work for charity?' Interesting question. Let's listen to the answers. I think it's a good thing. People don't want to listen to boring politicians but everyone likes celebrities so they listen to what they have to say. When Bob Geldof and Bono organised Live8 a few years ago, everybody was talking about how to end poverty in Africa. My little brother was only twelve years old, but he was talking about it. That can't be bad. I hate it. The celebrities only want publicity, and they want us to think that they're really nice people, you know, they care about the world, they care about poverty, so they can sell more records. But it's a big lie. They're not interested in poor people or the charities at all. Why is it a problem? The charities need money, and if celebrities can help them to get more, then what's wrong with that? I think that some celebrities only want publicity, but, well, who cares! The charities get some money, that's the really important thing. If you think for example, Angelina Jolie or George Clooney is really cool, then you want to do the same things that they do. So you might give to charity too because you want to copy your favourite star. I think it's a good thing. Helping people is cool nowadays. I think the celebrities do it because they copy other celebrities. Everyone's doing it nowadays - it's the fashion to do work for charity. I hate it. These film stars make millions of dollars for a film and live in houses that cost millions of dollars, and travel in private planes and stay in expensive hotels. And then they go and visit some 'poor people'. It's ridiculous. OK, some interesting answers there. Hmm. Do you have an opinion about this question? We'd love to know what you think. 'Is it a good idea for celebrities to do work for charity?' Or do you have an idea for a question that we could ask on Your Turn? Send us an email at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org - and we can take your question into the street. Carolina OK. Now - it's time to meet Carolina. Carolina is from Venezuela and she's visiting Britain for the first time. It's a big adventure for her - she's going to live, study and she hopes, have a good time here in the UK - and we're going with her! Carolina's going to study in Newcastle in the north-east of England. She speaks very good English but this is her first visit to Britain, so some things are very strange for her. We're going to follow Carolina in our podcasts and listen to some of the conversations that she has in lots of different situations. Today we're going to hear what happened when she first arrived in Britain from Venezuela. Here's Carolina at Heathrow airport in London. Let's listen to her conversation at Immigration Control. Excuse me. Am I in the right line for immigration? Erm, I don't know dear. It depends. What nationality are you? Venezuelan. No, no, this queue's for British and European Union members. You need to go over there - where it says 'Other passport holders'. Can you see? Oh, yes, OK, thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Where have you travelled from today? From Venezuela, from Caracas. Can I see your passport please? Thank you. Is this your first visit to the UK? Yes it is. And what are you going to do here? I'm a student. I'm going to study at the University of Newcastle. Is it a full-time course or a part-time course? Erm, full-time, it's a full-time course. Hmm. I've got my letter from the university here. Do you want to see it? Yes please. Here you are. Thank you. And how long is the course? How long do you intend to stay in the country? Three years. Three years. Hmm. Yes, that's right. Do you intend to work in this country? Oh, no, no, I'm not going to work, well maybe in the university holidays, but the British Embassy in Caracas said that was OK. Yes, that's correct. Students can work in the holidays. Is everything OK? Yes, everything seems to be in order. I just need to stamp your passport with today's date. Here you are. Passport and letter. Thank you. I hope you enjoy your stay. Newcastle's a very nice place. Go down the stairs and turn left to collect your baggage. Thank you very much. Good evening sir. And where have you travelled. Hmm. Carolina did really well there. Airports can be so difficult. I think she did really well, too. I hope she can come and join us in the studio soon. I'd like to meet her. Well, that's almost the end Wait a minute Ravi. Don't forget Gordon. Gordon? What do you mean? He wants to tell a joke. Oh no Don't be horrible. Gordon! Joke time! Come on Gordon! Are you ready? Yes, I'm here. I hope this is good Gordon. How long have I got? One minute - at the most. OK then. Erm, right. A chicken walks into a library A chicken? Yeah. A chicken walks into a library, walks up to the counter and says to the librarian “Book, book”. The librarian gives the chicken two books - she puts the books on the chicken's head - and the chicken walks out of the library. One hour later, the chicken walks back into the library. It walks up to the counter and says to the librarian “Book, book”. The librarian gives the chicken two books and the chicken walks out of the library. An hour later, this happens again. “Book, book”, and the chicken walks out of the library with two books on its head. But this time the librarian thinks, “Hmm, this is strange” so she decides to follow the chicken. She goes out of the library and follows the chicken. The chicken crosses the road, walks along the street, turns the corner, until it comes to the lake. Sitting by the lake is a big, fat frog. The chicken gives the books to the frog and the frog looks at them and says “Read it, Read it”. Oh Gordon, that's terrible. And that's the end of this part of the show. We have to go now but don't go away. After this little break you're going to hear Tom, our English teacher. After every show, Tom talks about the language you heard and gives you ideas to help you learn. So, don't go away, but we'll say goodbye now. See you next time. Bye! Don't forget to send us your emails! Here's that address one more time. It's learnenglishpodcast2britishcouncil.org. Hi, I'm Tom. At the end of every podcast you'll hear from me. I'm going to talk about some of the language you heard in the programmes and talk about ways to help you learn English. Remember Carolina in the airport? Listen to part of her conversation again. Is this your first visit to the UK? Yes it is. And what are you going to do here? I'm a student. I'm going to study at the University of Newcastle. Carolina and the Immigration Officer are talking about the future - Carolina's time in Britain. To talk about the future they both use 'going to'. The Immigration Officer says “And what are you going to do here?” and Carolina says “I'm going to study at the University of Newcastle”. They both used 'going to' to talk about the future because they are talking about plans. When the Immigration Officer says “What are you going to do here?” he's asking Carolina what her plan is. And she says “I'm going to study” because that's her plan - she decided it before she left Venezuela. So, we use 'going to' to talk about future plans. But listen to another part of Carolina's conversation. Thank you. And how long is the course? How long do you intend to stay in the country? Three years. Three years. Hmm. Yes, that's right. Do you intend to work in this country? Oh no, no, I'm not going to work, well maybe in the university holidays, but the British Embassy in Caracas said that was OK. The Immigration Officer said “How long do you intend to stay in the country?” and “Do you intend to work in this country?” Again he was asking about Carolina's future plans - but he said “Do you intend”. “Intend” is a formal way to talk or ask about plans. You might hear this verb, “intend”, at an airport immigration desk or on an immigration form. It's another way to ask about your plans. One more thing. Did you notice that when Carolina arrived at the desk the Immigration Officer said “Good evening”? He didn't say “Goodnight”. Do you know why not? We only say “goodnight” when we say goodbye or when we go to bed. When we meet someone after around 5 o'clock in the afternoon we say “Good evening” and we only say “goodnight” to people before we go home or before we go to bed. OK. In another part of the show we heard Daniel and Alice playing a game. Listen to part of it again. You've got ten seconds to write down things you can find in a kitchen. OK, Daniel how many? Erm, five, Tess. How about you, Alice? Erm, seven, I think. OK, let's hear your seven words, Alice. Things you find in a kitchen. Erm fridge. Cooker. Pans. Plates. Knife, fork, spoon. I hope all of you have a notebook where you keep new words - a vocabulary notebook. Think about how you put new words into your notebook. Do you put them in alphabetically? All the words beginning with 'A', then all the words beginning with 'B'? Or do you organise your new words another way? Some people put words into their notebooks in word families. They put words together that are connected in some way. For example, you could have a page in your vocabulary notebook called 'kitchen' and you could keep all the words from the game - fridge, cooker, pan - all of those words - on the 'kitchen' page of your notebook. You could have pages for, say, sports -'football', 'tennis' 'bowling' and so on. And you can write more than just the words - you can write the verbs that go with the words - 'play' football but 'go' bowling or 'go' skiing. There's no right way or wrong way to keep your new vocabulary. You have to find the way that helps you remember the new words. OK. Oh, erm, by the way, if there are any words from the game that you don't know remember that you can find them on the website. You can read all of the podcast and if you click on a word it'll take you to a dictionary that tells you what the word means. We'll give you that address again at the end - so go and find a pen to write it down! Right, finally, after every podcast I'll try to show you something that you can try to use in your own English. This week I heard this interesting expression: Excuse me. Am I in the right line for immigration? Erm, I don't know dear. It depends. What nationality are you? Now. There are two things there I want to talk about. Firstly, the old lady called Carolina “dear” - she said “I don't know dear”. Sometimes, older people might call you “dear”. It's a friendly, affectionate thing to do. But be careful! It might sound a bit strange if you try to use it yourself. The other thing I noticed was that the old lady said “It depends”. She didn't know the answer because she needed more information. Can you translate “it depends” into your language? Try to use it in English this week. OK. I'm going to stop there. I'll talk to you all again next time. Remember you can send your questions to me at learnenglishpodcast@britishcouncil.org. I'll be happy to answer your questions! In a moment you'll hear the address for the website where you can read everything you've heard in this podcast. Right. That's all for this time. Bye for now! See you next time.\n",
            "Can I help you? Yes, have you got this T-shirt in other colours? We've got it in white, black, red and purple. What size do you want? Medium. OK, in medium we've got black and red. And in purple? No, just black and red. OK, red. Can I try it on? Yes, of course. The changing rooms are over there. Is it OK? Yes, I'll take it. That's £10.95.

Now first, you need to take away all of the things that stop you working. What do you mean? First, turn off your music. Music doesn't help you study. OK. No music. And put the dog outside! What? Well, every time the dog goes into your room, you stop studying to pat it. Spot stops you working! OK. Bye, Spot! Have an apple and a glass of water on your desk before you start. Here you are. Why? Because then you don't need to go to the kitchen for something to eat or drink. OK. Turn off your phone. No way! Yes. It stops you working. If you turn it off, it's easier to concentrate. You can read your messages later. OK, but I can't turn off the internet on my computer. I need it to look up information. OK, but you can turn off your instant messages. I know! Mum? Yes? Thanks.\n",

Your name, for now, is Jane Doe. Jane Doe. That's a nice name, isn't it? ... On your papers it says Jane Doe for now. When you wake up, you can tell me your real name. OK? ...

Two months before the plane crash... Welcome to the FBI Bank Robbery Department. I'm Agent Sanders. Are you ready? Yes? Good. Come with me, please. Yes, thanks. This is not my first day. I know. Your name is Nick Kowalski. You were in another department of the FBI for five years. You worked in an office. But this is different. We don't work in an office in this department. We work on the street. Yes, Agent Sanders. I'm happy to be here. Who am I working with? You're working with me. I'm your boss for now. Are you OK with that? Yes. Yes. Of course, I just didn't think What? Nothing. So, what's our job? Good question. What is the name of this department, Kowalski? The Bank Robbery Department. So, we are going to catch some bank robbers. Good morning, Jane! And how are you this morning? ... You have a visitor, Jane. Agent Kowalski from the FBI. He said he had to see you. Is that OK? I said you were very tired... Now, Agent Kowalski, she's asleep, OK? She can't talk. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm sorry. But I have to see her. Only for five minutes. Well. Be nice to Jane. Jane? Yes, Jane Doe. It's the name we gave her... We don't know her real name. How is she? Ask the doctors. I think she's very lucky to be alive. She's in a coma, but she is getting better. Can she hear us? We don't know. Some people in a coma can hear everything. Other people can't hear anything. We don't know. Where are her things? Did she have a bag? She only had her clothes. No identification or purse. No phone. No bag. Hmm. So... was she on the plane? We found her very near the plane, yes. But was she a passenger? The doctor told me there were only two people on the plane. They were both men. They are both dead. I can't say. Well, that's enough. Thank you, Nurse... Bryson. Nurse Bryson. Well, Nurse Bryson, that's all for today. If she wakes up, can you call me? Of course. Oh. One more thing. Can you give my colleague some information? Your name, your phone number, you know... OK... Go outside for a moment and see my colleague. His name's Scott. He's outside. I can't leave Jane here alone... She won't be alone. I'll be here, I need to write some notes. OK, then... 'Jane Doe', huh? You can hear me, can't you? ... I know your real name, Agent Sanders... I'll see you around, 'Jane'. Wake up soon.\n",

Just a second. Yes? ... No, our Jane Doe is fine... Let me look at the chart. Hmm. Last night there was something strange. Like she was stressed. Were you stressed last night, Jane? She's normal again now... Yes, doctor. Of course, doctor. There's someone at the door now, I have to go. Hello? Are you... Nurse Bryson? Yes, I am. Can I help you? My name is Officer Brian Garner. I'm with the sheriff's department. Hello, officer. What can I do to help? I'm here to see your patient, and ask you a few questions. Well, I already talked to your friend at the FBI. FBI? Friend? What are you talking about? Agent Kowalski. He was here yesterday. Hmm. Strange... I didn't know this. Did this man show you his identification? Yes... I think so. I... I can't remember. Don't worry. They never tell us anything. Anyway, do you have any information about your patient? Clothes, personal objects? Anything like that? There were some clothes, yes. But no identification. We call her Jane Doe. Hmm. Jane Doe. OK. Listen. Here's my card. If you see the man from the FBI again, can you call me? Yes, I can. Thanks. Maybe... What is it? Do you think Jane is in trouble? I don't know. But maybe this is about the big robbery a few months ago. Robbery? Yeah. Two months ago there was a robbery of a bank truck. The robbers were never caught, and the money is gone. Two million dollars. But what is the connection with Jane? We found the truck near the airport where the accident was. Oh. It's probably nothing. A coincidence. Anyway, I'll let you go.

About you and Buddy. One of you took the money. Buddy's dead. We can't find the money... It wasn't on the plane. That means someone hid it somewhere... I need to find the money. These are dangerous people, Sanders, the bank robbers. If I get the money for them, everything will be OK... And I think you know where the money is. Do you know where it is? I know you can't speak.

It's the only family you have. Oh, we know about him. Poor boy, he hardly ever sees his FBI sister. Both his parents dead. He lives alone in New York City... Maybe I'll visit him. Maybe I can make him help me... If you don't answer me right now, I'm getting on a plane to New York. You know what I'll do, right? ... Good. Good. Let's get started. Hello? Excuse me, what are you doing here? I'm Agent Kowalski, FBI. Just visiting the patient here. It's 10 p.m. There are no visitors now. Of course. Of course. I'll come back later then.

You have to write the important words. You don't need to write the extra bits. Look. King Henry the Eighth was married six times. That's important information.

The crown is for 'King' and the 'H' is for Henry. That's cool. Then the heart is 'love' and a number six well that is ehm six. Yes. So look at these notes. Let's test your memory.

            "OK, before we continue, does anybody have a question? Oh, lots of questions, I see. OK, we'll go one at a time. Yes? Thank you. You talked about Fibonacci numbers in the lecture. Sorry, I don't understand. Can you explain? Of course. What do you want to know? OK I hope this isn't a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean? No question is ever silly - it's always good to ask. OK, it's the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages. Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don't get it. The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works? I'm not sure. OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5. Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important. Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere. Could you give us some more examples? OK... well, we don't have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?\n",
            "My presentation is about how you can use colour coding to organise your homework. To start you need a few things from the stationery shop. This photo shows the things I use. They aren't expensive. They are all cheap. I've got coloured pens and pencils, sticky notes, page markers, glue and folders. First, I choose a different colour for each school subject. The colour I choose has to be easy to remember so I make sure it means something to me. Maths is green because my ruler is green. PE is yellow because my trainers are yellow. Here is a photo of my folders. I use the cheapest kind and I add a coloured sticky note to the top and to the front. I keep all my notes inside the different folders. This is a photo of some more sticky notes. I wrote them in the library when I was studying. The blue notes are for history. My history teacher has got a blue car! The black notes are for geography. One day I want to visit the Black Sea. This photo shows the pages I need to read for homework. I use two coloured page markers to mark where it starts and ends. Those blue ones mark the pages I need to read for history. Finally, this last photo shows my wall calendar. This green star shows I have a maths test on Friday. This pink circle shows I've got French homework for Monday. It's pink because 'pink' is 'rose' in French and the rose is my favourite flower. Has anyone got any questions?\n",

That's the order management team. Luciana deals with the new orders. She's the one with short, dark hair. In the purple dress? Yeah, that's right. You'll probably work closely with her while you are learning about our ordering process. Got it, thanks. And who's that over there? The guy who's on the phone? Oh, you mean the one by the window? In the green shirt? Ah, that's Ian. He's the marketing director. And that's Maria beside him. She's responsible for the internal IT systems. OK, I'll try to remember all of this. I should probably be taking notes! Don't worry about it. For now it's just good to put some faces to names. OK, great - and who do I talk to about setting up my mobile phone with email access? Is that also Maria? No, you need to talk to Sebastian who works in communications. He can help you. That's him over there, next to the printer. Thanks. I'll introduce myself to him later.\n",
            "I work on Saturdays and in the school holidays. Saturdays are busy because that's when everyone goes shopping. Our shop sells clothes and accessories for men, women and children. I work in the children's department. It can be crazy sometimes, but it's fun. I work during my summer holidays when I'm not at university. Oxford has thousands of tourists in the summer, so it's easy to find a job as a tour guide. I take tourists to visit the university colleges and then we go down to the river. We go along the river on a boat. The tourists love the boat trip, but last summer one tourist fell in the river! I love meeting people from all over the world. I like my job, but lots of people don't like coming to see me because they hate dentists. Sometimes it's very hard work, but it's great to help people when they have a problem. It's so important to look after your teeth. My job is very difficult, but I like it because I love flying. I fly planes that take people to different places on holiday. Most of the time I fly in Europe to places like Spain, Greece and Italy. The most difficult thing about my job is when the weather is bad. Snow and thunderstorms are the worst. The best thing is visiting different places. I work in a hospital in the city centre. It's a very big hospital. I help the doctors with the patients. I give them their medicine and look after them when they feel ill. I love my job but I don't like the uniform and sometimes I have to work at night.\n",
            ",and I'm pleased to announce that we've had a small but steady increase in ice cream sales, in spite of the unusually low temperatures in the last three months. We'll see whether this trend continues. What packaging do you recommend for the smaller type of bottle? Well, I'd wrap it in clear plastic and tie it at the top. OK. But don't you think a box would be better, perhaps with a pattern on it? Boxes are dull and a pattern on the plastic would look untidy. Right, we'll do as you recommend. Mike, could you show some people round the factory tomorrow? Certainly. The usual tour - from reception to the warehouse? They are particularly interested in our production techniques, so I would start there. OK, and then through customer relations and into the warehouse. Thank Anne, that supplier we use has become very unreliable, and we've decided to look for another one. Seems a good idea. We don't need to inform our clients, but could you send a note round to all our departments when we've decided who to replace the supplier with? Yes of course. What time's the MD back tomorrow? Erm.. just after lunch, I think. Why? Well, I've got a meeting tomorrow at a quarter past two, but I need to be here when the MD arrives - I'll rearrange my meeting for three. Well, Paul's coming to that meeting, and he has to leave early. OK, I'll make it a quarter to, then. Our sales figures show that toy trains haven't done very well, although we've sold a reasonable number of the dolls. As for model cars, we've sold so many that we can't produce enough! We've got to fill those vacancies in research urgently. That's why today's meeting's so important. Yes, but the advertisement's only just gone out. Why discuss the interviews now? The closing date is next Friday. It will take us a day to look at the applications. If we decide on the interview questions today that'll save time. Is the company doing better this year? It's a mixed picture really. Sales have risen by about fifty per cent, which is excellent, but our total market share is down to five per cent from twenty per cent last year.\n",
            "Okay, I just want to update you on our main plans for promotion this autumn. The main campaign will of course be the pocket dictionary, but we also have a reasonable budget for the new road map, which is coming out next month, as you know. For both titles, we've already taken full-page adverts in 'Travel' magazine and I'm also considering space for the dictionary in that new monthly 'Reference Now'. For window and general shop display, our designer has produced the wonderful stands you can see in the corner. I'm sure you'll agree that the orange is an improvement on the green stands we had last year! Erm, we're looking at a range of free gifts for handing out at exhibitions - currently on order are calendars and keyrings, but possibly in future larger things too, like umbrellas for major clients. I'd like your views on that idea before I go ahead. Alison's managed to negotiate some air time on Radio East and I'm going to visit a TV network on Friday - that's more relevant to our future titles though. Now, publicity material - everything is listed in the annual catalogue, which will be ready to send to booksellers in December. And talking of bookseller mailshots we've also got one going out in September, which will be our information sheet. Finally, I can confirm the venue for the dictionary launch party, which is next month. Some of you know we were trying to get the university library, but in fact, we've now booked the management centre, which will be excellent. Their catering is supposed to be very good,\n",
            "There's quite a lot to talk about. Well Sue, it doesn't matter if we don't cover everything today. Ok, David, let's see how we go. Things are looking good, aren't they? Definitely. I'm very pleased. We've gone beyond our sales targets. Our share price is stable. And, of course, you know Eurocom were going to move but they've chosen to keep their contract with us after all. But winning the prize for British Exporter of the year was the best thing, as far as I'm concerned. On the other hand, there is the problem of rising costs. Yes, even though we avoided another rent increase, But all those expensive newspaper advertisements, Yes, that's the real problem. Although they are partly balanced by the decrease in import duties. Mmm, meanwhile, you want to limit our expenses where possible? Yes, certainly. Actually, the budget for entertaining clients is fairly reasonable, and very necessary. It's the cost of phone calls that worries me. It seems far too high. Everyone should be using e-mail wherever possible if you want to save on communications generally. Um, we've already got cheaper paper from the printers, which is a start. True. Now on to training. We need to be clear where this demand for training is coming from. Well, our own success, basically. Our customer base is expanding all the time. Our staff, ,.who are up to date with new computer applications, Yes, they're ok for that, but they have to deal with all these new clients. They'll need a wider range of skills than they have at the moment, We could contact the business school. Perhaps they could send us some of their trainers. Or what about the courses they run? But then again, it seems a pity not to use our own training department. Doing it ourselves, you mean? Well, yes, after all, it's the people here who know what we do best and can really understand our needs. I agree. OK, what's next? Um, there's the printing of the new brochure. Is the basic information changing? I shouldn't think so but the whole thing really needs to look a bit better. The current one just doesn't give the right idea at all, Much too old-fashioned. Yes, a new presentation, a proper lay-out. What about out-of-date products? Steve's already taken them out. Now, do you want to talk about the supplier situation? You mean the situation with Johnson's? Yes, they're just not giving us what we need. Their prices have always seemed very reasonable, but the products aren't good enough. There's no point being cheap and on time if we don't actually get what we want. Right, well, we need to deal with the situation. What contact have you had with them? I wrote to them twice last month, and it didn't seem to have any real effect. We've looked at every order as it comes in, so we already have a fairly clear picture of the problem. Hmm, I think you should start by ringing some other firms, see if they can match Johnson's deal. Then I'll make a decision. Right. Great, we did manage to discuss everything. Yes, good.\n",
            "Human Resources, Helen speaking. Hello. It's Alan Thomas, phoning about the vacancies here in Customer Services. I'll just take the details to put in the ad. It's for 5 telephone operators, isn't it? It was 5, but we're busier now and also 2 staff are leaving this week, so we need 8 new people. OK. I'll put that. And are these grade 1 posts, salary 14 to 15 thousand? Starting salary is fourteen thousand, but I need some people with experience, so we'll pay up to sixteen thousand nine hundred and fifty. That's the top of grade 2. Fine. Holidays, next. The usual 21 days a year? Actually, the telephone staff are working longer shifts now, so they get an extra 12 days off a year. Together it's 33 days. OK. Do you have a reference number for these posts? Yes, it's CS zero eight zero double one. Right. We'll advertise next week, September the 7th. What start date shall I put? The 6th of October? I wanted them to start on the 1st, but your date is better. So, put that. And will you be their line manager, Mr Thomas? They'll actually report to Sue Blackmann, that's double N. And who can people contact? Sue. She's on 795 double 3 5. Right.....\n",
            "Anna, that supplier we use has become very unreliable, and we've decided to look for another one. Seems a good idea. We don't need to inform our clients, but could you send a note round to all our departments when we've decided who to replace the supplier with? Yes, of course. Company borrowing in the first half of this year was below last year's levels. Borrowing reached 40,000 in February, before dipping in March, then climbing again immediately to exceed its earlier peak. This was because, Hello, I've arranged to see Mr Stevens at a quarter to three this afternoon, but I really need to see him urgently this morning. Is he free? Mmm, there's nothing until 2.00 today,.. actually let's say 2.15, as he's attending a business lunch. All right, I'll keep my original appointment then. It'll have to wait. Thanks anyway. Steve here. My flight's delayed. You could start the meeting without me, or wait for me. But maybe we should postpone. I don't want to, but I think that's what we'll have to do. Sorry about that. We'll need another supplier for the new order. What's wrong with the existing one? I know quality hasn't always been first class. It's not that. They're usually reliable. But this new order means we'll need to double our output and our supplier hasn't the production capacity to provide those amounts. I see. We might even find a less expensive one, too. Hello. I'm here to do the regular safety inspection. Oh, the production manager's in the packing department. Can I show you round? OK. Let's start with your paint stores, and then the assembly line. I can show you the assembly areas, we don't store paints at this site any more. Fine. And then we'll meet your manager in the packing department. Is Mr Davis there, please? I'm afraid he's in a meeting - it's due to finish at 11. OK. I'll ring again at 11.30. Could you possibly make that 11.45? He's rather busy. Mmm, I'd prefer a quarter past, if you don't mind. I've got a meeting myself later this morning. All right, I'll let him know. And your name is,? How did the company do last year? Well, it started off quite low and things didn't move at all for the first six months. So it was looking better by the end of the year? Certainly was. Our latest research shows that consumers in the home market are satisfied with our products. We now plan to look at Eastern Europe, and establish how many potential customers there are. It's a mistake to simply follow our competitors.\n",
            "Good morning everyone. My name's Janet Porter and I'm going to show you round the conference facilities here at the Chiltern Centre. The first thing you probably noticed as you drove here today is the Centre's excellent location, with the motorway just five minutes away. This allows us to operate a free bus service to and from the airport, which takes about 50 minutes. Okay, this is our main conference room, which holds 400 people. It's fully equipped as you can see. The chairs can be set in rows like this or, for a smaller number of people, around tables. We provide speakers with a radio microphone which allows them to walk around freely. All delegates receive our information pack in which they'll find a map and writing materials. Now, at the back of the room you'll see two doors - each leads to an open area, where we provide coffee. Lunch is served in our restaurant on the ground floor. There are four rooms on this floor that are suitable for exhibitions and the Green Room, just at the end of the corridor is perfect for seminars. I'm afraid it's in use today so I can't show you. Now we'll take the lift to the third floor. Just near the lift you'll see our noticeboard, which is for the use of conference delegates. Here on the third floor, we have our Business centre, which has internet facilities, fax and phone. There's a member of staff here from 7 am until 10 pm, who can help with any social programme, for example booking theatre tickets, or recommending restaurants in the city. Right, are there any questions so far?\n",
            "Mr Warren, thanks for talking to me today. Not at all. Firstly, let's talk about the new joint venture you've just announced with the French group, CDLE. What will Mirador get from the deal with CDLE? Is investment involved? Not in the manufacturing side. In this deal we become distribution partners. We will get from CDLE all the experience of their top beauty care laboratories, which are the most technologically advanced in the world. What we can offer them is our own expert knowledge of the UK market. How soon do you expect the new deal to show in the company's results? Well, I don't expect any immediate dramatic improvement. In the current year's results, in fact, I expect no increase, nothing important, anyway. In the following year, though, I'm confident of excellent results. So good news to come. That's interesting, because there were worries about falling profits, particularly in your export market, weren't there? Yes, profits have fallen. This is a result of the constantly changing exchange rates in the countries we deal with - not usually to our advantage. However, we've actually seen a 6% increase in export sales. One reason is because we've considerably improved our export product mix. But you're confident of Mirador's future? Oh, absolutely, yes, we're very confident that our order books will be full next year. This is because of the very high level of enquiries about our products that we are experiencing, . And now, we're about to start planning a whole range of exciting product launches for the new year. I see. So what would you say's been the main focus for Mirador in the past year? Well, instead of expanding into the retail market in Europe like other companies have, what we've actually done is concentrate on our commitment to customer service in the UK. In the coming year, we will aim to strengthen our focus on product development and design. I noticed that Mirador's turnover was, well, disappointing let's say, from January to April of this year. Why was that? Was it just that you had the traditional low sales after the new year break? The real cause of the problem was simply that retailers didn't need to order very much from us at the beginning of the year because their own stock levels were so high. And so our turnover figures looked low. These figures will increase when supplies of the new products reach the shops. Ah yes, I see. Back to the new venture. Which market are you aiming for with your new products? What we want to do is move away from branded products that you purchase in specialist retailers or the best department stores and get our products onto the shelves of quality supermarkets, with their own labels on them, just like they do in France. Excellent. One more question - what aspect of the business do you think you need to pay most attention to now? The last year's seen a lot of changes for us - we've had a major reorganisation of the three business divisions, involving quite a lot of staff recruitment, development and retraining. Over the next few months, we've got to have a number of meetings with CDLE and concentrate on reviewing our long term business plan for the company. [fade] It's good to hear you so confident, Mr Warren. [fade] Thank you for talking to me.\n",
            "Hello, Charlotte here. I'm not available so please leave your message after the tone. Hello Charlotte, Luke here. I'm calling about the financial services conference. I've just been to the Grand Hotel to check out their facilities. Their biggest room holds 300 when it's arranged in a theatre layout. We've already had enquiries from about 250 people about the conference so I think we should go for that one. It's called the Goldsworthy room - G-O-L-D-S-W-O-R-T-H-Y. They could put in 20 rows of seats - the area of the room's 24 by 12.75 metres, so that's the maximum number you can have according to fire regulations,. Now dates - we wanted mid-July, but it's already booked from the 14th to the 16th, so I've gone ahead and asked for the 12th. They've pencilled that in for us and I have to confirm it in writing by the 31st of March - they usually get a lot of bookings from the 25th onwards - so the sooner we can make a decision the better. Then,.. the price. We'll get it for £760 - there's an introductory discount for new clients - it's normally £980 per day for that room. We can discuss catering later - the main thing is we've got the conference room,.. They've given us a reference number - it's JQZ9880. And the contact at the Grand is Victor Price. (fade) OK? Speak to you soon. Bye.\n",
            "Hi, it's Jack. Just phoning to see if I should bring anything for the barbecue? Mum's got some chicken she says we can have. Chicken's everyone's favourite, so we've got loads thanks. I could bring some burgers. Well, Anna's made about twenty. Oh, that'll be plenty. How about some sausages? Hold on, I'll just look in the fridge,ah, there aren't any left. Well, don't worry. We've probably got enough here. I could pick some up on my way over. It's no trouble. Well if you don't mind. Sure, no problem..\n",
            "So, how did your rock-climbing trip go? It was harder than I expected. It's all very well climbing on an indoor climbing wall. I've always been pretty pleased with the way I've climbed there. But out on real rocks in the hills, it's a lot scarier. You need to have someone with you who's got a lot of experience, who can tell you what to do or give advice. I can imagine. I'm looking forward to having another try, though. But next time I'll tell whoever I'm with that I need support.\n",
            "Wow, it's so hard to get any better at the guitar. It feels like I'm not making any progress. Well, you seem to spend a lot of time practising. I don't see how you could do much more. Don't you think it's better to focus on one type of music rather than on lots of different types? I don't know. Maybe it's good to go for lots of different ones. Well, anyway, you ought to pay attention to the really top players. They've been along the same path that you're on. Just notice how they do things. I think I do that already really.\n",
            "I've just finished reading that book. It's brilliant - so much happens. It's exciting all the way through. Yeah, though it does get slower in the middle, when the hero Alan is trying to decide whether to tell his mum about the baby lion he found. Alan's personality seems really true to life, and so does his mum's - like the way she reacts when he tells her all about it. I know what you mean - it reminds me of my mum and me. I never thought she'd let him keep the lion though. That was a nice surprise. I kind of thought that might happen actually.\n",
            "What a great concert. I listen to that band a lot, but I'd never seen them live before. Me neither. But why didn't they play their greatest hits, especially if you think what we paid to get in. I liked what they did, though. As for the price, it was definitely more than I'd normally be willing to pay. And the organisers didn't do a very good job. It was awful waiting so long for the main act to start. Don't blame the organisers. It's simply that the band hadn't arrived. There was nothing they could do about that.\n",
            "Hi, many thanks for inviting me. I've been a TV news presenter for four years now. I did a couple of other jobs after university, first in radio in my home city and then as a journalist on a magazine. I enjoyed both jobs very much. I present the five o'clock evening news. There's a lot of preparation to do before I start. First I get the newspapers and go through each one carefully. That way I understand what's in the news reports I have to present that day. Then I have meetings with the editor of the news programme in the TV studio. After that I have to spend a bit of time choosing the right jacket to put on! I think it's really important, because that's what you see when I'm sitting at my desk, reading the news. But at least I don't need to worry about my trousers or my shoes as no\u0002one gets to look at those! What do I find particularly difficult? Well, I sometimes say things wrongly! I don't often make mistakes with the names of cities or countries, whatever the language, but it's names of people which I sometimes find a real challenge to get exactly right! Now, I can't choose what news to present of course! But I do have my favourite topic. I really enjoy business, so reading news about that is always interesting to me. For some of my colleagues, the most interesting subject is politics or even fashion. We're all different! What about the future? I've been told I could make a good actor. I've never been attracted by that, though. As a teenager, I always dreamt of becoming a producer. I still think it would be exciting if I get the chance. Maybe I'll do that one day. Now, any questions,\n",
            "How are you? I was walking on the ice last week, and I wasn't really concentrating because I had a terrible headache. Anyway, I slipped and fell and I landed on my shoulder. At the time when I fell, my shoulder really hurt but that pain soon wore off. I think maybe I damaged something a bit more serious in my ankle though. I'm going to get my ankle checked at the doctor's, because the pain still hasn't gone.\n",
            "Hi Mandy. You started off as a successful disc jockey and now you're a singer in a great new band! When did you get your first job as a DJ? Well, when I finished school, I trained as a nurse for a year, but I wasn't very good at that. I'd always loved music, and I wanted to save money to buy equipment, so I started looking after elderly people. As soon as I had enough, I bought what I needed. I got my first job as a disc jockey almost immediately. But then you started singing instead. How did that happen? Well, I'd been a disc jockey for about four years, then last year, I read about a DJ competition in Ireland and I entered. I did some live singing on stage that night and one of the judges asked me if I'd be interested in 10 singing professionally. I was very lucky, really. So now you're in a band called 'Dish'. Tell us about your new record, the one that's in the shops now... Yes. It's called 'Up and Down'. It's about a girl who is never really happy with her life. She's always up and down, wanting too much and never being satisfied. I'm not that kind of person fortunately, nor are my friends! It does have a nice ending. And you're working on a new CD? Yes, but we haven't finished recording that yet. There are still two more songs to do but I'm very proud of it. It's traditional rock but we've included some electronic music too to make it really unusual. I just hope the public will buy it! We think it's great! And what kind of music do you listen to at home? That's difficult. The music I like best has words that mean something to me, I suppose. I love dance music too, but you can't listen to it all the time and I generally prefer female artists to male, I think too. But that depends on the singer. And your future plans? Oh! I've got so much work to do at the moment - television performances and concerts, it's hard to plan. But I'd really like to own a night club one day... somewhere great to dance, so that's my next project. One day, perhaps I'll try to learn to play the guitar - that would be nice - but I'm too busy to think about it at the moment. I can write and sing, that's what I do best. Well, lots of luck with your new CD and thanks for coming. You're welcome!\n",
            "Now, everyone, follow me into the museum. This room is where the ancient jewellery's displayed - some fantastic pieces here - and next door are paintings of rock stars by the artist Ben Soper. We'll visit that at the end of the tour, for the talk I'm going to give you about them. But before that, I'll take you into the garden where you can have a look at the old racing car we've got there! It was generously given to us by a famous racing team when the museum was built,\n",
            "And finally we have a story about a zebra, which escaped from the local zoo this morning. Surprised motorists saw the animal walking down the side of the road during rush hour and reported it to the police, who followed it as it walked right through a shopping centre and on down to the river. They succeeded in catching it when it stopped to eat some grass. The zebra is now back in the zoo, and doesn't seem at all worried by its trip into town and the busy traffic it saw.\n",
            "Did you have a good weekend? Yes, I went out with a couple of friends yesterday. Where did you go? Well, they wanted either to see a movie or to go swimming. I said I'd rather go to the science museum, but they weren't so keen on the idea. Anyway we tried to get into the pool, but there was a big swimming competition going on there, and by that time the film had already started. So I got what I wanted in the end - and it was fun actually.\n",
            "Okay here are this week's new computer games. Dance Moves teaches you how to dance. There's a great range of moves and a great choice of classic hits from the last 5 years. The only problem is knowing when to quit. Pet Project has a choice of baby zoo animals to care for. Although they're super cute, you'll quickly feel as though you've seen it all before. The last game is Cooking Star, it seems a nice choice for anyone who's passionate about food, but imaginary food has a limited attraction.\n",
            "Hi Pat, how was the holiday at the watersports centre? Did you do lots of sailing? I did yeah. I'm pleased I did a course last year,it meant I could go straight out on the water. And I was able to try windsurfing too. It's actually quite easy if you've already sailed. I just had to learn how to keep my balance. Did you do any other sports? Yeah, water skiing. My little brother was old enough to do it too this time, so he was really happy about that! Great.\n",
            "So, how did you like the campsite? Brilliant! Thanks for telling my dad about it! It's got everything - shops, swimming pool, games room. And a beautiful beach five minutes away. I knew you'd love that. The pool's good enough for me. I had the best time ever - so much to do! When we first got there, I felt a bit lost. But then I started hanging out with loads of other teenagers. That's why I'd go back any day - in other camps you don't get that sort of crowd. I remember one where it was mostly families with little kids. I know what you mean.\n",
            "I've got a friend who wants us to do homework together. I'm not sure it's a good idea. Well, I've tried it and it works for me, depending on the subject. But if it's something you really need to concentrate on, then you're better off on your own. I suppose it would make it less boring, having a few laughs and some jokes here and there, That's exactly it, and you can do it in half the time it takes you on your own, because you're helping each other.\n",
            "Hi Lucy. Have you been shopping? Yeah, getting stuff for my room at college, What's it like? Well not large! There's a bed, a desk, but nowhere to put books. And there's only one big light in the ceiling. I'd prefer to have a lamp on my desk, so that's what I got today. If I've got enough money, I'll get some bookshelves next week. They had some lovely big cushions on special offer in the department store - I nearly got one today actually - so maybe the bookshelves can wait.\n",
            "You'll never guess. I've won first prize in that art competition I went in for. Wow! Congratulations! What's the prize? A weekend in New York with free entrance to all the art galleries there. That's fantastic! I know. But I have to go before the end of the month and I can't get the time off work. Oh, no! Yes, I can't believe I have to miss such a great chance. At least you know the judges thought highly of your work. I suppose so, but it wasn't one of my best pictures.\n",
            "My flat-mate's driving me crazy! I can't believe that! She's so shy. Yes, never says a word - I do all the talking. I've got nothing to complain about there! She has her music a bit loud. I can see that'd be annoying when you're trying to study. Actually, it's the way she never picks anything up that bothers me. Her stuff is all over the living room and bathroom as well as her bedroom. Her music helps me concentrate, so I don't mind that.\n",
            "Not a great day for our team. Well, they didn't win. But, actually, considering how many guys couldn't play because of injury, they didn't do so badly. They played well actually. I heard they're putting more effort into their training programme, and we're beginning to see the benefits of that. That's right. I think the main trouble they had tonight is that they just don't believe enough in their own ability. Yeah.\n",
            "Pity we didn't win, but we played quite well. You played well - I was rubbish. I need to practise a lot harder. It's difficult to find a time when we're both free for more practice. I know. And I must improve my fitness first. You can run all over the court and attack every ball. I'm not a good athlete like you. How do you do it? Well. I go to the gym four times a week. That's what I need! Can I come with you? I want to be in really good shape for our next competition. Sure.\n",
            "Hi everyone! Anita here. On today's programme I'm going to tell you about the week I've just spent in Cuba. We arrived on Sunday, and on Monday morning we went on our first visit, this was the National Gardens. These are full of trees and flowers and there was a fantastic waterfall that everyone stopped to admire, although the rainforest exhibition was the bit I liked best. On the second day we went on a trip in a sailing boat to swim with dolphins. We had a very exciting time - we had to wear special electronic arm-bands to keep off any sharks! No\u0002one saw any,fortunately! We had the option of travelling to a river valley in the countryside west of Havana the following day; I felt a bit worried as the programme included crossing a range of hills by horse and I haven't ridden much. We met a noisy motorbike on the track, but I managed to stay on somehow! On Thursday there was a day's visit to the capital city: I loved the atmosphere of the shops and restaurants. We went to a theatre to see a musical in the afternoon - luckily not a serious play, which would be difficult for me, though my Spanish is improving. On Friday, we went on a visit to a farm. I thought we were going to see coffee being grown, but in the end we went to a farm that produces sugar. It was OK though. We had lunch there. It was quite a celebration with guitars and delicious food. Saturday was free for us to explore. I found a street full of jewellery workshops and bought a few rings to take back as presents for people back home. I was sorry later that I hadn't bought any of the beautiful leather belts back! Maybe next time.\n",
            "Good morning. This is your captain speaking. I'd just like to apologise for the late departure of the flight. As you know, we had to wait for the runway to be cleared of snow before we could take off and get on our way. We'll arrive in Manchester in about an hour, and we're told the weather on the ground isn't good - there's heavy rain in the city, and we're expecting strong winds at the airport as we land, but we shouldn't be too far behind schedule. Thanks for your attention.\n",
            "I'm talking to champion swimmer Vicky Prince, who started competitive swimming as a teenager. Why swimming, Vicky? Well, though my parents are interested in sport, they aren't great swimmers themselves, and we didn't go swimming that often. I learnt at school like everyone else, and just seemed to be good at it, so my teacher persuaded me to go in for competitions. I mean I did join a swimming club later, but that wasn't where it all started. Did you have to do lots of training? I did. I used to get up at five to go to the pool, which was a thirty-five-minute drive from our house, where I'd swim till eight. I'd have breakfast in the car while Mum was driving me to school. After classes, I did exercises in the school gym to build my strength, before lunch. Then later on, it was back to the pool for another three hours. So it was a hard training programme? Yes, it meant I couldn't go to things like parties because I had to get up so early, but I got used to that. Much harder was losing two of the friends I'd known since I was very young because I couldn't go out much. That was tough. I also missed school trips to France though I did get to go there later, so it didn't matter in the end. But you won a national competition? Yes, I was in the team that took first prize in the national finals. I always swam for enjoyment, so I was surprised to find myself holding up a cup! I hadn't swum that well in the semi-finals, so I guess the crowd were more interested in the other swimmers in my race. So that made it easier to do well. Of course, I'd trained hard too, but I always did. And now you're a coach, teaching other people. Yes, I've just done a qualification to be a coach, but passing on my own experience is how I can really help them. And because I've both won and lost in competitions, and recovered from that, it's something I can share with people. Winning isn't just about technique. And you've taken up long-distance swimming? Yes, just as a hobby. I mean I do want to maintain my fitness levels, but that wasn't the main reason for choosing it. And long-distance swimming in the sea isn't all fun - it can be hard work - but you do get to see some wonderful places, and that's what attracted me to it.\n",
            "Hello, I'm just ringing to book an activity at your leisure centre for the weekend. I was hoping to book a sailing lesson, but I understand from your website they're all full, so I'm wondering if there are any cycles available to hire instead - there's no information about those. I'd really like to join one of the group rides through the forest - I think I'd enjoy that more than the car racing I tried last time. Could you ring me back to confirm? Many thanks.\n",
            "Have you chosen a cake yet? I'm not sure. I guess you're having the lemon one? How did you know? Because you always do! I suppose I do! So what about you? Hmm, I might try the one with the strawberries on. You had that last time and you weren't keen on it, remember? I'd go for the chocolate cake if I were you. Mmm, the chocolate one does look good. Might be a bit sweet, though. Oh, I think I'll have the same as you.\n",
            "Stacy's Supermarket has some wonderful offers for you today. Buy six bottles of Stacy's own fruit juice, in any of our great-tasting natural flavours, and the price will be only £9.99 - that's a huge saving. And we have a mystery present for all shoppers. To get yours, buy goods today with a total of at least £19.99 and we will reward you. And take a look at our special party food - buy everything for a birthday meal for six, including a cake, for as little as £29.99.\n",
            "Did you have a good day out on Sunday with the children? Yes! We'd planned to go and see the big fish at the Sea-Life Centre - which opened recently - and then go and see a film. We got to the Sea-Life centre, and it was so full, we were told to come back an hour later. We did, and it was worth the wait. Much more fun for the children than the art gallery we saw some weeks ago. Couldn't get to the cinema, though, but we had a good day.\n",
            "Good evening. It's eight o'clock and time for tonight's news. There's something for all tastes coming up later on. If you're staying up late tonight, then you can catch a repeat of last Saturday's Come Dancing programme. If you don't have the energy for that, then stay on this channel for Quiz Challenge with teams from Manchester and Oxford competing in the final. Before that, however, you can watch Lucas Wilson preparing some traditional Polish dishes. But now, here's the eight o'clock news.\n",
            "I see you've been to that new clothes store in the shopping centre. Oh, you saw the logo on these bags! Yes, it's really popular. I got a couple of tops and some trousers. Who did you go with? On my own, but the assistants were nice - telling me whether things suited me or not, and getting me to try different sizes. The coolest most fashionable stuff has already gone, but I was glad I found things I liked that didn't cost too much. They weren't expensive compared to some things there. I'd better tell my sister to get down there.\n",
            "I've got tickets for the Blue Angels concert on Saturday. Would you like to go? Yes, great! How did you get them? From their website. I tried to do that once but I had to give up. It wouldn't let me pay for some reason. Yeah, it's confusing. I had to phone the help line. They showed me how to do it. They should just make it simpler. Otherwise I've no problem with the website. It posts new stories about the band members nearly every day. Yeah, and some of the replies to fans from the two guitar players are really funny.\n",
            "11 things you never knew about elephants There are only two types of elephants, African and Asian. Female Asian elephants don't have tusks. Elephants can be left-tusked or right-tusked, like being left- or right-handed. A newborn elephant weighs more than 200 pounds. That's about 30 human babies. Elephants have eyelashes. The African elephant is the world's largest land animal. Adult elephants cannot jump. They don't like bees. An elephant's trunk has more muscles than the whole human body put together. Elephants can get sunburnt. They use sand or mud to protect themselves. Elephants are pregnant for 22 months. That's almost two years. How amazing are these animals? © BBC\n",
            "Morning, everyone. Quiet, please. Right, OK. So, today I'm going to give you some advice to help you prepare for the exams next week. So, make some notes as I'm talking, please. Everybody ready? Now, while you're studying, eat food that gives you energy. Don't be tempted to eat sweets or drink cola. Sugar won't help you study but fruit and cereals will. Apples, actually, are especially good. Find a comfortable place with plenty of light when you study. But not 'too' comfortable or you'll fall asleep! Try and keep a positive mind. It is easier to study when you are positive and relaxed. Now, if you start feeling anxious, have a little break. Go out for a stroll around the block. Don't try to learn everything. There isn't time. Just choose the 'important' things, the things that'll get you the most points in an exam. And if you aren't sure about this, ask me. First, learn the main ideas and don't worry too much about the details. If you have time, you can come back later and read the details. Make notes of these key points and read them, then cover them up and try to remember all the points. Now, it might be boring, but repetition helps you to remember. Use past exam papers to study. They will help you understand what kind of questions come up. There are plenty of past exam papers in the library. You can photocopy them and take them home. Take regular breaks while you're studying. A five-minute break every half hour is usually enough. Get some fresh air and stretch your arms and legs. Drink a glass of water too. It's important to keep hydrated. And, last but not least, good luck! I'm sure you'll all do your best.\n",
            "Hey, I'm reading this really interesting article about the human body. Yeah? Well, we know all about that from biology lessons. No, we didn't learn much at all at school! They're discovering loads more things all the time. Really amazing things! Did you know that only about one tenth of the cells in your body are really you? The rest are bacteria. What? I'm not really me? No, of course you are you, but you also have millions, or trillions, of bacteria in you. Eeeeuuugh! No, they're mostly really helpful. Someone did an experiment to see if animals can live without bacteria, and he found that a lot of them died or had to have a special diet. Animals need bacteria to digest food, you see. So we're better off with bacteria. Unless the bacteria are bad. Unless they are bad, but they're nearly all good. Oh yeah, and going back to cells, do you know how many cells you have in your body? Quite a lot, I'd say. A good few. Yeah, but how many? I don't know. I'm not mathematical. 7 octillion! That's 7 plus 27 noughts. I knew it was a lot. OK, that's an amazingly huge number, almost impossible to imagine. But the really weird thing is that most of the atoms are empty space, just air or nothingness. And if you took out the empty space, you could fit your body inside a tiny cube which measures one 500th of a centimetre on either side. That's a box measuring 0.002 of a centimetre on each side. You'd be much too small to see. Mmm, I can imagine that. It sounds like something that would happen in a really bad Hollywood movie. You know, a mad scientist goes: 'I'm going to extract all the air from your body'. OK, enough facts for one day. Don't go! One last thing, did you know No. Did you know that you probably have mites in your eyelashes? Mites in my eyelashes? What are mites exactly anyway? Yeah, they're very small creatures, like insects, only not insects. They're about a third of a millimetre long, so you can't really see them. These particular mites live in eyelashes and eyebrows. But in mine? Well, maybe not. Only about 50% of people have them, and more older people. So you might not have any. Anyway, they're completely harmless, they just eat dead skin. Yeah, right, harmless. I really would have preferred not to know that. Sorry. I mean, really!\n",
            "So, today's expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today. Thanks for having me! So, I have to confess today's topic is something I am really bad at, listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn't so bad. At least I'm in control of it. But listening woah people speak so fast and it's like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it. No, you're not strange. In fact, it's really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can't ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it's gone. Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, 'Sorry, can you repeat that, please?', especially if I still don't understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don't do this - quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I'm still lost! They do, don't they? In real life, you've got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can. Yep, sounds familiar! But, obviously that's not going to help if it's a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you're just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn't matter. But imagine you're at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then? I hope you've got the answer, Gabriella, because I'm coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations! The other strategy is to summarise what they said. But how can you do that if you didn't understand what they said? Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, 'OK, so the first thing I have to do is?' and make it a question. Or, for example, 'And which office is that again?' Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you're controlling the conversation a bit more. I get you...\n",
            "Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what's wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier. This lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life? Now, I'm going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? This answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness. Csikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow. The theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow. Csikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn't notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it's difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away. For the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi's life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. Right, let's get started. If you look at the next slide\n",
            "Sorry. Sorry, excuse me. I'm just just coming to sit over here. Phew. Hey. How's it going? So, what have I missed? Nothing. He just started around five minutes ago. Did he say anything about the mid-term? What? About the mid-term tests. Did he say anything about when he was going to hand them back? He's almost finished marking them, he said. We get them next Tuesday. I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. When do we get them? Tuesday. Next Tuesday. OK. Got it. Sorry. What page are we meant to be on? Page 34. Page 34. Oh, wait. I don't have my textbook. Can I share with you? Wow. This is hard stuff. Mmm. What does SEO mean? What? SEO. This is all about SEO but he hasn't said what it means. Search engine optimisation. How to appear on internet searches. Internet searches. Right. Right. OK. He said what it meant. What? He explained it before you got here. Oh. Right. OK. Can you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to the lecture. So am I. Sorry. Sorry, one more question. What does this have to do with the American Revolution? What? I don't get it. Why is he talking about search engines in a course on the American Revolution? What are you talking about? This is a class on software engineering. You mean, it's not Early American History? You're in the wrong class. Oh, wow. Now it all makes sense. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Here, I'll just excuse me. I'm in the wrong class. Excuse me. Thanks. Sorry.\n",
            "Hello, can I help? Yes, my wife sent me here. I, erm, need something for a sore throat and I can't stop coughing. It really hurts. Do you have a headache too? Not really, no. Well, we have this syrup. And these lozenges. Which is better? They're both good. The syrup is more expensive. Oh, well I'll take the lozenges, then. How many do I take? Just one. Sorry, I'm sorry. Er, how often should I take it? Just one every four to six hours. Take it before mealtimes. Are you allergic to any medicine? No. Then you'll be fine with this. Can I get some antibiotics too? I'm afraid you need a prescription for that. Ah. You know, you should really see a doctor if that cough continues. Thanks. I know. Anything else? No, thanks. That'll be £7.49 then, please.\n",
            "Hello, Junko Mori speaking. How can I help you? Hi, Junko, it's Andrea here from Red Band. I'm calling about our latest order. Everything arrived OK, right? We got the delivery confirmation at our end. Yes, everything's fine with the order. I'm calling about the invoice and the payment terms. I need a favour. A favour? What do you need? This is a little, er... difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms. I know they're usually 30 days, but we're having some cash flow problems. You'd really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days. I'm not sure if I can do that, Andrea. We've got regulations at our end, and also have to manage our own cash flow. I promise this won't become the norm, Junko. Actually, I also want to place another new order. The same size order as last time. It's for an important customer and they pay on delivery. I see. So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered. Exactly. That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea. Let me see what I can do. Yes, I think we can make an exception this time. That's great, Junko. I appreciate your help. And we appreciate your business, Andrea. It works both ways. Thanks again, Junko. Can you send me a quick email confirmation of the payment terms extension? Sure, no problem. We're happy to help you. Great. And I'll email you the new order. Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for it. Talk to you soon. You too. Goodbye.\n",
            "So you've got a few minutes to discuss with your partner. So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life. Yeah, but do we know that's actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn't it? It says here it's about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold. True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun? No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it's about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million. Yes, but in space that's not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That's why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn't sound so big when you look at it that way. I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you're right. What other similarities are there between the two planets? Let's see not the colour, obviously! Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons! Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth. What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth's day is 24 hours but Mars's is about half an hour longer. You're right. OK, any other things they both share? I suppose you could say they have water in common. Could you? How? Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It's just that most of the water there now is probably frozen. Ah, I see. I don't think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth's air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars? Mars doesn't really have air, not compared with Earth. It's got about one per cent as much air as Earth. Right, and it's mostly carbon dioxide. Gravity is another difference. I didn't know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it's much less than on Earth, of course. Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth's gravity. OK, let's see what you've found\n",
            "As you know, our team has grown a lot in the past year and we feel we need to address the diversity in the team. How do you mean, 'address the diversity'? Well, we all know that diversity in teams is a good thing, but it can also be a challenge for some people to respect and value people's differences. We've got a really diverse team here - people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages and sometimes I don't feel we make the most of this. Yes, and even if it isn't specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different. So, what does this mean? What are we going to do? Well, we need to create a workplace charter. You know, one that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion. That sounds like a good idea. But will people just see it as something the management team has created? Maybe they won't even pay attention to it. I know. That's why we're going to involve everyone in creating it. That's a good idea. We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace. Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves. Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things. Yes, I know, but if there's no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate. I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do? Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion? Sure. I'll be happy to. And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself. Something that's not the usual seminar-style environment? Sure. That'll be fun. And I'm going to do some further research into how other organisations are benefiting from their diversity. I can share this with the whole team.\n",
            "Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week, as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared - just a few patches of cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday. It's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather, and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy - and even thundery in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight. Elsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England, tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees. By the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain. The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until tomorrow. Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can!\n",

They really liked Poppy, didn't they, Poppy? They liked Poppy? Yeah. The guy said... Oh, hang on... Hello? Who is it? Yes, it's Ashlie. Oh, that's fantastic. Thank you. Sure. Sure, yeah, that's fine. Er, OK, alright. Thank you. Bye. What is it? Well? I got the part. That was quick. And they want Poppy, too! Wahey! Well done, girl. What about me? Well done, Ash.

Oh, hi there. I think I've got an appointment at ten. Yes, of course. Poppy, isn't it? Yes, that's right. Thank you. Thank you. Right, Stephen. I think I saw a beauty salon for humans on our way here. So you wait here and I'll be back in a couple of hours. What? Ashlie! What? I can either go now while we wait for Poppy, or after we're finished here. Oh come on, Stephen! You ran off to the gym yesterday and left me with her. You can look after her today. But she's your dog! I don't want to spend the whole day watching you and Poppy get pampered. Oh, stop complaining, Stephen. I need to look my best for the filming. Well, that's going to take more than a few hours. Ha ha. Very funny. She looks like she's enjoying it. Thank you. She looks lovely. Just like Ashlie. What sorts of people bring their pets here? Oh, all kinds of people. And why do you think people bring their pets here? Oh, British people, they love their pets. They're part of the family so they want them to look nice. Well, she certainly looks happy, healthy, and beautiful - don't you? Ta-da! Very nice, Ash. And what do you think of Poppy? Oh, she looks amazing! Aren't you gorgeous, Poppy? Aren't you gorgeous? Well, looks like you're both ready for filming. Come on, let's go. So, have they told you much about it? The advert? Not really. I was too excited to ask. But if it's on TV then everyone will see it. I'm really excited about it. I hope it doesn't start to rain before we get there. Poppy looks so nice, she shouldn't get wet. Maybe you should carry her there so she doesn't get dirty? Nonsense. Eh, Poppy? No! Absolutely not! Stephen, can you take her? Ashlie, you're unbelievable. Come on, I need to get there. Hurry up! Look! Stephen! Hi, Ash. What is it? The DVD! What DVD? The DVD of the advert. Go on, put it on! Oh look, there's Poppy! She looks amazing. Umm, yeah... shhhh - I'm watching... Ashlie, is that your foot? Shut up, Stephen... What? Is that it? Where am I? Oh, Poppy. You looked amazing. Good job you spent all that time in the salon, Ash - your leg looked great! Oh, shut up, Stephen!\n",
            "What about this, Stephen? Typical, Ash. You choose the biggest thing in the market for your tiny flat. Well, yeah... I guess it is a bit too big. Let's look over there. We can't take too long. We've got to go and say hello to Pete. Yeah, OK... We're at an art market - it's a kind of market where artists sell their art. Ashlie wants to buy some art for her flat and she's already seen about ten things she wants to buy.Stephen: Hi, Pete. How's it going? Hi, guys. Great, thanks. It's quite busy today. There's lots of people buying things. Wow... so you're actually making some money? Yeah, of course. This is a great place to sell art. Right, well, let me give you a hand. You need a proper salesman! Right, OK - you stay here. I'm off to find some art for my flat. OK, but don't be gone too long - and don't spend all your money! Hi there. Ooh, how much are these? They're twelve pounds. They're very cool. Are they all your own designs? Yeah, they are. Liachild is my own brand. Good luck with it! Thanks a million. Thanks. Thank you. So what did you buy, then? Nothing, actually, but I've got an idea that could make us some money! What is it? Well, I'm going to make some art, come back to the market and sell it! Brilliant idea, huh? Yes, excellent idea! Except one thing... You're not an artist. Well, I can learn, can't I? All great artists had to start somewhere. Well, if it's that easy, why don't we both try and make some art? And then come back next week and try and sell it? Stephen, I reckon you won't be able to sell a single thing. Sounds like a challenge. Why don't we make it a bit more exciting? In what way? Well, the one who sells the most is the winner... and the winner gets to keep all the money we make. Agree? Agree. Ah! You're going to be giving all your money to me! Oh, yeah, right, whatever. Come on then, I need to get some inspiration. So this is art, is it? Err, yes, Stephen, it is. Looks like a pile of old junk to me. Art is all about ideas. Try and look at what the artist is trying to say. This is harder than I thought. Come on, let's have a look over there. So Ash - what do you think of this? I have been trying to understand the message. What is the artist trying to say here? Well, what do you think, Stephen? I guess he's trying to make us think about the modern world. He's using a rubbish bin to show how everyday objects... Stephen - that is a rubbish bin. Come on, you. Let's make some art!\n",
            "Can I help you? Yes, maybe. We're looking for something, some materials. You know, we want to make our own art. Sure. How about this? It's a candle-making kit. It's one of the most popular products we sell. Hmm, that looks a bit easier than painting. I really like that Stephen. I think I'm going to make my own candles. I'm looking for something a bit different. OK. Well, how about this? Everyone always needs soap. Ooh, soap! That's a better idea than candles. Thank you. Stephen, you need to take your time. This is art. You need to think about the colours. Ash, us artists, we prefer to create. You know, do what comes naturally. But you need to be more careful. Prepare. You need to read the instructions - err, and I think you need to mix the colours first. Oh Ash, I don't need to read the instructions. I'm nearly finished... and we've got so much to do. Stop dreaming and start making candles. OK... Ha! I'm going to win. I've got ten times more stuff to sell. Stephen. It is not about quantity. It is quality that counts. Well, it is a competition, Ash. And whoever sells the most will be the best salesman and the best artist and I am going to sell the most. Hmmm. We'll see. How much are these? Oh, they're three pounds each. Can I have four, please? Yes! That will be twelve pounds, please. Oh... Would you like a candle for a pound? Er, no, thank you. How are you getting on, Ash? Not too bad - I've sold a few more. I've sold more than 20 bars of soap. That's more than 60 pounds. Not bad, eh? Come on, Ash. I think I've won. Hand over the money. OK then, Stephen. Here you go... you win. There's one of my customers from this morning. She bought four bars of soap. Maybe she needs some more. Excuse me. I bought this soap from you this morning. Yes? And I want my money back! And so do I, Stephen. Come on. I want my money back, too.\n",
            "Oh look, Stephen. I can see the Isle of Wight.Stephen: Ah - you'll never guess what I've done.Ashlie: What Stephen? I don't believe it. What have you forgotten?Stephen: I don't have my passport!Ashlie: Stephen, we're not leaving England. You don't need your passport.Stephen: Oh, so you mean I don't need any foreign money after all?Ashlie: Ha ha - very funny. We're heading to a music festival on the Isle of Wight. It's an island on the south coast of England.Stephen: It's called Bestival, and I can't wait. There's going to be music, food and camping.Ashlie: I love camping; fresh air, stars at night...Stephen: Don't you mean, er, insects, cold showers and sleeping on the ground?Ashlie: It's going to be brilliant, Stephen. I just hope the weather's good, I do not fancy camping in the rain.Stephen: Well, you know what I always say; be prepared! So I've brought clothes for any weather. We'll be fine.Ashlie: Well, we're almost there. So we better head to the van. Come on you. I'm so glad we borrowed a camper van.Ashlie: It's cool, isn't it. Very retro!Stephen: I know. There aren't too many of these vans still around. This one's nearly forty years old.Ashlie: Oh, so just a bit older than you then!Stephen: Ha-ha. Come on. I want to have a look round the festival.Ashlie: OK, well I saw some interesting stalls over there.Stephen: Oh, I want to go to the main stage. I want to see some live music.Ashlie: OK, well I will meet you at the tea tent then in an hour. Have fun! Oh! Hey you scared me there! You guys look great. What have you come as?Festival Goer 1: Erm, the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland.Ashlie: Oh wow. I've noticed a lot of people in fancy dress, actually. What's going on?Festival Goer 2: Oh it's erm - at this festival, every year, everybody gets dressed up.Festival Goer 1: And the theme this year is fantasy.Ashlie: So what does fantasy mean?Festival Goer 2: Fantasy means anything from outer space to Alice in Wonderland.Ashlie: Well, I must say you guys look amazing. I'll have to remember that one for next year. Have a nice festival guys! Hi, can I help?Ashlie: Oh yes. Can I get tea for two, please?Waitress: Would you like a high tea?Ashlie: That would be lovely, yes please.Waitress: I'll just be a minute.Ashlie: Thank youStephen: Hey Ash!Ashlie: Wow Stephen!Stephen: Did you order tea?Ashlie: Yeah. Nice fantasy costume. But what on earth are you? You look like an alien.Stephen: What are you talking about? This is my rain gear. I thought I felt a few drops earlier.Ashlie: Oh.Waitress: High tea for two.Ashlie: Thank you. Come on then, let's set up camp.Stephen: Are you really going to sleep in your tent, Ash?Ashlie: Of course I am. I love sleeping under the stars, you know, getting closer to nature.Stephen: Well, I'm staying in the camper van. I don't want to sleep on the ground.Ashlie: Stephen you can't do that. That's not proper camping.Stephen: Yes, but I've got running water andeven a fridge.Ashlie: Well, I still say that that's not real camping.Stephen: It is to me and besides, you snore.Ashlie: I do not!Ashlie: Where's my tent?Stephen: There you go. We need to get everything sorted before it gets dark. Right, that's me done!Stephen: Do you need a hand?Ashlie: I think there's another pole or something somewhere.Stephen: Are you sure you don't want any help?Ashlie: No, I'm fine, I know what I'm doing.Stephen: OK, if you're sure.Ashlie: I think I've sorted it... Ta da! Right, I'm off to bed. See you in the morning.Ashlie: OK, night!Stephen: Night!Ashlie: Stephen!\n",
            "Morning Ashlie. Morning. Sleep well? Come on Ash, get up. I need coffee! I'll put the kettle on. Oh Ash, we forgot the sugar. I'll see if any of the other campers have some. Hi there. Hello. Erm... I was I wondering if I could borrow some sugar? Yes sure, here you go. Ah thanks. Hi, I'm Stephen, and that's my sister Ashlie over there. Pleased to meet you. My name's Andy. Where are you from? I'm from Sheffield. Where are you guys from? Ah, we're from London. Great tent! Yeah it is great, isn't it? It's got two sections; one for sleeping one for cooking. Is it easy to put up? It's really, really easy actually. All modern tents are simple to put up. Er yeah. They are, aren't they? Stephen, kettle's boiled! Er - excuse me, when's your next show? In an hour. So, who are you? We're the River People Theatre Company - we do folk theatre with puppetry and live music. So do you get to travel much around the country? Yeah - a bit - we've started. This is our first big festival. Er... and so we're going to do a bigger show and do more next year going to do all the festivals next year. Ah wonderful - well, hopefully I'll catch your next show. Yeah. Thanks very much. Take care - bye! Look Ash, a yoga class. Let's join in. It might be a bit advanced for you. I'll be fine, just watch me. If you're sure. Er... Ashlie, I don't think I can get up. Can you give me a hand? Come on you. I think you need a bit more practice. What do you mean? I'm a natural! Hmm yeah. I'm starving. I think it's time for something to eat. Yeah - let's go back and have a BBQ back at the campsite. Great idea! Right, I'm an expert at this. I've got my charcoal, all I need is dry sticks and a stone. How about some matches? That's cheating. But I'm really hungry! OK, OK. Here you go. Do we have any bread? Ah no - I'll have to go and get some. Great. Stephen - it's burning! Oh no The food, it's on fire! Oh the food's ruined! And my tent is soaking - come on! We can't cook anything else on that now. We'll have to go into town and get some more food. Stephen! It won't start!! What are we going to do, we're stranded!\n",
            "Hi there. This is China Town, right in the centre of London. This is one of London's most exciting areas. The streets are full of Chinese shops, Chinese restaurants and markets. It's my birthday today and we have got some friends coming over to ours tonight for a special meal and Stephen has kindly agreed to cook us all some Chinese food. And hopefully today, I'll be picking up some great cooking tips and some fresh ingredients. Wow! This place is amazing. Look at this, Stephen. I don't even know what half of this stuff is. Yeah - what do you think this is? I don't know, but I hope you're getting some ideas for the meal tonight. Yeah, absolutely. I'm getting great ideas for tonight. Come on, I know a great restaurant that does really good Dim Sum. Dim Sum. What's Dim Sum? This looks incredible. Is this what you're planning to cook tonight, Stephen? Let's go inside and try a few things. Hmmm. I can't wait to try some of these amazing dishes. Come on. Let's see if it tastes as good as it looks. Wow. I'd love to know how they cook this stuff. Do you think they'd let me visit the kitchen? I'd love to meet the chef. Let's ask the waiter. Excuse me? Yes. Welcome to the Golden Harvest. Can I help you? Everything is fabulous, in fact the food is excellent. Thank you. I wonder if you could do me a favour. I need some help. Yes, sure. I have to cook a special Chinese meal tonight and I was wondering if I could go to the kitchen and meet the chef. Do you want to meet the chef? I wanted to ask the chef a few questions. You know - get a few tips on how to cook Chinese food. Ah, yes, sure. He's very busy but let me see if he's got the time to talk to you. Thank you very much indeed. Hello, thank you for seeing me. How you do, Sir, thank you. I was wondering if you could give me a few quick tips on how to cook Chinese food. Yeah, to cook Chinese food, one, you must have a very good chef. The chef is very important. Very important. And number two? And number two, the food must be fresh. Fresh ingredients. Yes, fresh ingredients. And what are we going to cook today? Today we'll cook Kung fu lobster. Kung fu lobster. \"A take away menu... this might come in handy later.\" That was great. Really interesting and a bit scary! I learned a lot and you know what? I've got a list of all the ingredients that I need for tonight's meal. Well, you have no excuses now. I'm expecting the perfect meal tonight. Come on, let's finish the shopping. So you can get home and do the cooking. So is that everything, then? Let me see, garlic, noodles, lobster, mushrooms - yep. That's everything. Except one thing. What's that? A chicken foot. Ugh!\n",
            "Ashlie's going to the hairdresser's to get her hair done before tonight, which leaves me just enough time to sort out dessert. It's a bit of a surprise for Ashlie. I thought I might get her a nice cake. Hello there. How are you, sir? How can I help you? I'm looking for a cake for my sister's birthday. Do you have any birthday cakes? Yes, of course we do. We have a selection in here. If you'd like to choose one? I like the look of that one. What kind is that? It's a chocolate mousse. Can I write a message on it? Yes of course. I'll just get the chef for you. Thank you very much indeed. You're welcome. Thank you. Can I have a go? I'll try and do a flower. Right. That's pudding sorted - I need to get home. I'm running a bit late. So I'd better hurry! \"This is a disaster! I'm glad I've got a back up plan.\" Great! See you in a bit. This isn't going well. My food looks terrible. I don't think any of this is edible. Hi Stephen. Oh no, Ashlie's here. Hi! Oh Happy Birthday Ash! Thank you. Come in. Hi guys, you alright? How's it going? How are my tasty Dim Sums coming along? The food's going... err Well, it's been hard work, but it's looking, OK. Good, well, I'll just pop this in the fridge, then... No! Don't go in there.... What? Why not? Because I don't like anyone watching me when I'm cooking. And it's a complete mess in there. Er... OK! I'll get that! Well who's that? Everybody's here already. That... That is your surprise. My surprise? Yes, your surprise. I've got a surprise guys. I wonder what it is. Shall we sit and have some food then Thank you. You've saved my life. Wow! Stephen. That was really amazing. That tasted almost as good as the food we had in that restaurant earlier. Er... yeah. Haven't I seen this somewhere before, though? The guys in the restaurant were really helpful. I followed the recipe and I'm glad you like it. So, what's my surprise? Er... well, I made you a birthday cake! Wow Stephen, that's amazing! You have been busy, haven't you? Nothing's too good for my sister. Did you say that you made this cake? Yeah, why? Well it just... it seems to have a label saying, 'Hand-made in London'... it's the thought that counts.\n",
            "Near a black hole, space and time do some very strange things because black holes are probably the most violent places we know of in the universe. This river provides a beautiful analogy for what happens to space and time as you get closer and closer to the black hole. Now upstream, the water is flowing pretty slowly. Let's imagine that it's flowing at three kilometres per hour, and I can swim at four. So, I can swim faster than the flow and can easily escape. But as you go further and further downstream towards the waterfall in the distance, the river flows faster and faster. Imagine I was, er, decided to jump into the river just there, on the edge of the falls. The water is flowing far faster than I could swim. So, no matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, I would not be able to swim back upstream. I would be carried inexorably towards the edge and I would vanish over the falls. Well, it's the same close to a black hole because space flows faster and faster and faster towards the black hole. Literally this stuff, my space that I'm in, flowing over the edge into the black hole. And at the very special point called the event horizon, space is flowing at the speed of light into the black hole. Light itself, travelling at 300,000 kilometres per second, is not going fast enough to escape the flow, and light itself would plunge into the black hole. Well, as you fall into a black hole, across the event horizon, then if you were going feet first, your feet would be accelerating faster than your head, so you would be stretched and you would be quite literally spaghettified. Now, as you get right to the centre, then our understanding of the laws of physics breaks down. Our best theory of space and time, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, says that space and time become infinitely curved, that the centre of the hole becomes infinitely dense. That place is called a singularity and it is the place where our understanding of the universe stops. © BBC\n",
            "All around the world, festive days like New Year's Eve are celebrated with fireworks. But here in Britain, there is one night that is very special. It's November the fifth, Bonfire Night, and I'm wrapped up warm for some autumn fun. Tonight's the night for lighting bonfires and setting off fireworks. Here in Winchester, preparations for the celebrations are under way and tonight it's all going to get very noisy! Bonfire Night parties take place in towns and cities across Britain. The Winchester event is free and attracts over twenty thousand people. Steve Lewis of the charity 'Round Table' is the volunteer in charge. Steve, what's the plan for tonight's celebrations? OK, tonight actually kicks off at 6pm in the city centre by our Guild Hall. There's a torch-lit procession where thousands and thousands of people follow a band through the city and we all process down to the fields here. And then we'll follow that by the lighting of the bonfire about 7.15. At 7.45 the fireworks will go off and the crowds will cheer. It sounds like a hectic night. How many people does it take to organise this? On the night itself, we have a hundred and eighty volunteers and many, many other people to help us out. So it's hundreds of people involved in an event of this size. And be honest, is this about history or is it just an excuse to have fun? Bonfire Night is about history. It all comes from history of England and the Houses of Parliament. But it is great fun, too - great fun for us to organise and put on and great fun for everybody who turns up. So how did this all start? Four hundred years ago, a man called Guy Fawkes planned to kill King James by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. It was called the Gunpowder Plot. It failed, and to mark the event rag doll 'Guys' are burnt on the bonfire and fireworks are set off. Fireworks are made using gunpowder. Leon's probably got the best job in the world. He lets off fireworks for a living. Leon, talk me through the sort of display you're going to put on. There's about four thousand fireworks which all create different effects. Some will go up and go bang, some will spin up there, some will crackle, there's whistles What do you think it is about fireworks that the British public just love? It's a great tradition that we have here. If it wasn't for Guy Fawkes we wouldn't be stood here today. You know, it's a great... I love tradition. It's six o'clock and time for me to join the procession. OK, it's almost time for the fireworks now. Well, I thought that was fantastic - but what did the public think? Well, it was really nice to come up and meet up with my friends - and watching the fireworks, they were beautiful. I thought they were really good. They were even better than last year. They were really good and they were really colourful and they looked really cool. That's Bonfire Night over for another year - but there's always time for a final bit of sparkle.\n",
            "British people talk about the weather all the time because it changes all the time. The weather for us is a national obsession. This is BBC Television Centre in London. Here, the weather forecasters - or meteorologists - try and work out what the weather is going to do next. I've come to find out if it is possible to predict the weather. Is weather prediction an art or a science? Or maybe a bit of both? The Weather Centre is somewhere in the maze of the BBC. Their team of weather forecasters work on what the weather is doing night and day. Nick Miller presents the BBC weather. Hi, Nick! I've found you at last. Well, I'm a weather presenter. I like to spend as much time outside as possible. How difficult is the British weather to predict? Well, Britain is affected by lots of weather systems. They come at us from lots of different directions, and Britain's surrounded by sea. It's an island and the sea affects those weather systems, too. Does the weather vary across the UK? It can differ vastly from one end of the country to another because we're affected by lots of different weather systems, and you can have a weather system giving rain in one part of the country, and another elsewhere giving sunny, hot weather. Why do you think British people are so interested in the weather? Well, it gives us something to talk about. You know, lots of different weather all the time. Never the same from one day to the next, so if you run out of conversation, you can always talk about the weather. The BBC has forecast the weather on TV for 75 years and during this time a lot has changed. The graphics have changed too. There aren't any magnetic clouds or stick-on suns. Weather balloons, super computers and information on global weather patterns have made forecasting complicated, but more reliable. So Nick, how do you produce a weather bulletin? Well, I get the weather forecast, then my job is to translate that into what you see on television: a weather bulletin. And we do that with graphics - different graphics every day. So what I do is choose what graphics we need to suit the particular weather story from one day to the next. And what's the weather looking like for the rest of today? Actually it's not too bad across the United Kingdom. A bit of sunshine here and there, a few showers, some patchy rain in the very far south, but all in all, for the UK this summer, it's pretty nice. Brilliant news! But it's not always like this. Snow storms, flooding, tornadoes; they don't sound like typical British weather but we've had them all. Extreme weather is unusual in Britain so we struggle when it happens. We're used to our mild climate... so it's a shock when the weather turns really nasty. So, Nick, this is your weather studio. How does it work? Well, first of all it's much smaller than you might think. And it's completely self-operated. All I have to do is find my name from this panel here and the studio comes into life. The camera automatically rises to fit my height. The green screen comes on and I can see myself and the weather graphics in front of me so when I look behind I know where to point. All of this is then set up and I'm ready to do my broadcast. Do you think I can have a go? Of course you can, though you may be surprised, it's not as easy as it looks. It looks like there's going to be rain in the south, but it's sunny up north. But then there are some showers developing a little bit later, so I recommend you taking an umbrella out with you. How was that? Actually that's not bad - for a beginner! Thanks a lot. I think I did OK. But maybe I should leave it to the professionals.\n",
            "Yes, yes, yes I'm here to make your day! Hello? Hello? Hello? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! It's Santa on the phone. Oh, brilliant! How are you, my dear? I'm good, Santa. Marvellous. Would you like a little pressie for your Christmas? Yeah, I'd like a present. Yes! One thing, it's not for you. It's not actually for me? That's not fair. Why? Because presents are for giving, not for receiving, wouldn't you agree? Hee hee! You could give it to them. It's going to be wonderful! Now, you see that gentleman with the buggy? There's a lady with a blue coat Look upstairs, you see that gentleman? Chase after him, now with a big black bag. Run, now. Go, go, go! 'Scuse me Over there! Hi, I'd like to give you a present for Christmas. This is for you. Merry Christmas! I don't know what it is. So what's inside it? I don't know. Here you go. Do I have to? Ah, that's lovely!

            "Oh hi, Stephen. You made it then! Hi, Ashlie, I thought we were going Christmas shopping, not ice-skating. Oh, we are. But I saw the rink and ice-skating is so much fun. It's almost as much fun as shopping! It's Christmas Eve and this is the Tower of London Ice Rink. Ashlie and I are supposed to be doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. We're cooking dinner for the family this year. They're coming to Stephen's to give our mum a rest. And we've still got lots of presents to buy. So you shouldn't be messing around on the ice. Oh come on, Stephen. Come and have a go. What's wrong with you? Look watch me - I can go backwards! Stop showing off. Alright, I'll come on, but just for five minutes - no more. Come on then. Take my hand. That's it and we just go in a big circle like this It's not as difficult as it looks. I think I'm better than you. It's all about keeping your balance. Stephen, you're going in the wrong direction. Stephen! Watch out! Oh, sorry! Oh, I love Christmas, Ash. It's so exciting. I know. All the presents, the wonderful food. I can't wait. Wow, look at these. They're great. Oh, I love these. Look, it's snowing! Let's get some Christmas decorations. These are so cool. Well, maybe we could get something for the tree. What about some tinsel? I want the tree to look really tasteful and stylish. These are nice. Those are really boring. What we need is lots of different colours to make the tree look really beautiful. Mmm, well, I'm not sure. I think the tree will look better with just a few decorations. No way! A Christmas tree is meant to be bright and colourful. Oh come on, Ash, let me choose some Christmas decorations. Well, I suppose so. As long as you don't get too much. Listen, I want to go and buy your present now, but it's a secret. So I will see you later. Presents - of course. OK. Bye! Bye! There... perfect! Stephen! What have you done? What has happened to the Christmas tree? It looks so much better now, doesn't it? All bright and Christmassy. It's as big as the tree Mum and Dad had last year but it looks even better. But I wanted the tree to be stylish and beautiful. Now it looks like a kid's decorated it! Do you think we should add some more of these baubles? No, I really don't. Just don't put anything else on the Christmas tree, OK? Come on, let's hang up our stockings. OK. They look great. And look, I've put out some mince pies for when Father Christmas comes down the chimney and some carrots for the reindeer. Ah, that is sweet of you. Hmm, mince pies! They do look good. I'm starving. I suppose Father Christmas won't mind if I have one. Maybe one or two won't matter.\n",
            "Morning, Ashlie. Merry Christmas! Happy Christmas! Nice hat, it suits you. Thank you. Here you go, here's your Christmas present. Oh thanks, Stephen. It's lovely. Just what I have always wanted. Here, I've got something for you, too. There you go. Socks! I love them. Thank you, Ash. I'm so excited. It's Christmas morning, but we have got so much to do today. We're spending Christmas here this year to give Mum a rest. And the family are coming over for Christmas lunch and I'm sure my sister's got it all planned out. Yep, I've got a list. At 9 o'clock, put turkey on to cook. 9.30, steam pudding. 10 o'clock, peel potatoes. 10.30... That sounds like a lot of work for you. I think I'll have a bit of a sit-down before everyone arrives. But we're doing this together, remember. You promised. I thought Christmas Day was supposed to be a holiday! Well, you've got to do something to help out in the kitchen. I tell you what; you can do the sprouts for the main course. If that's not too difficult for you? Of course it's not too difficult. OK, well, let's get cooking then. Come on. We've got lots to do. I'll help in a minute. I'll just go see if there's any of those mince pies left. Merry Christmas, Dad. Hello, son. Merry Christmas, Mum. Happy Christmas, Stephen, my wonderful boy! Oh... What a lovely tree. Did you decorate it, Stephen? Yes, Mum. It's lovely, you are so clever. Hello, sweetie. Happy Christmas, Mum. Happy Christmas, Ashlie. You look lovely. Oh, thank you. Lunch smells wonderful, dear. Christmas lunch is hard work, isn't it? I hope it's as good as yours. Oh, I'm sure it will be fine. I expect you've both been working so hard in the kitchen. I hope it's not been too much for you? Well... No, Stephen has been so much help. Come on, let's get back to work. Have a seat, Dad. Well, the turkey's cooking and the potatoes are boiling. But you still have to do the sprouts. Can you sort them out? Yeah, sure. I love Brussels sprouts. They're just like baby cabbages. What do you want me to do? Well, you peel them and then boil them, of course. OK. Easy I just need to do the stuffing and check on the turkey. Go ahead! All under control here. What do you think, is it done? Looks good to me, Ash. Maybe we should add some Christmas sparkle - a finishing touch! Not more tinsel Hey Ash, these sprouts are taking ages to peel. What do you think? Err, well, I don't think you need to do anything else to them Stephen or else there'll be nothing left. Let's put them on to cook and then we're ready. Who's for turkey, then? It looks lovely, dear. Yes, please. Ashlie, Stephen, did you remember the sprouts? What about the stuffing? It's not a proper Christmas dinner without stuffing! Yes, Dad, don't worry. Here's the stuffing.  ...and my sprouts are here, I did them! Oh, I I thought they were peas. But it all looks wonderful! You're both so clever. Come on then, let's eat up! Oooh - time for some presents. Here you go, both of you. I know you're going to love your Christmas presents. Thanks, Mum. Thanks, Mum! I made it myself. Put it on, it's just the thing for a cold winter's day. It's really er, cosy. I've never worn anything quite like it. Ooh... you look lovely, I knew you would. It really suits you. What did you get, Ash? Happy Christmas, everyone!\n",
            "Christmas shopping in London. There's nowhere like it in the world. When the West End Christmas lights go on and the big shops reveal their special Christmas window displays, it's time for the festivities to begin. Fortnum & Mason, here in Piccadilly, has been selling the finer things in life around the world for over three hundred years. From chocolates to china, luxury goods are what Fortnum & Mason specialise in. And Christmas is their busiest time of the year. Today's an important day. Parts of the Christmas window display have just arrived. Everything needs to be put in place. It's a difficult job getting all of the items into the windows. Paul Symes is the head of visual presentation and the creative force behind the Fortnum & Mason Christmas window display. This is so exciting, Paul. You've allowed us behind the scenes in your Christmas shop window. Now tell me about your design this year. It's all about dancing, burlesque, theatre, shows and glamour and style. And what are the challenges involved in designing something to this scale? One of the challenges is trying to get it all to fit. There's so much that you want to say and it's trying to get it small enough to fit into just seven windows. So, Paul, you're about to reveal your Christmas shop window. How nervous are you? Very, very. I start getting nervous about a week before. A lot of effort goes into making sure that when we finally pull the curtains up, everyone's happy. The Christmas story dates back two thousand years, but the way it's celebrated has changed a lot over time. Many Christmas traditions are actually quite recent. Fortnum & Mason have seen Christmas fashions change over the centuries. Archivist Dr Andrea Tanner is interested in the history of the store. Andrea, when did Christmas shopping become such an important tradition? Well, in Britain, it really came with the Victorian era. It was when Queen Victoria married her German prince, Prince Albert, and he brought lots of Christmas traditions to Britain. What's your biggest selling Christmas item? It's a hamper. A hamper is a basket in which you find wonderful Christmas foods and drinks and we expect to sell around seven and a half thousand of those. It's almost time for the big moment. The windows are finally going to be revealed. It's going to make people stop and stare. I think they're fabulous, but they always are. It's absolutely beautiful. It's beautiful. It's a huge success and I'm starting to feel festive. Now where's my Christmas list? Better start some shopping.\n",
            "There are almost 200 classic cars here at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, in Hampshire; including 1930's motors to modern day racers. So what makes a car a classic? And why are there so many British classic cars? Well this is a great place to find out more about Britain's motoring history. The motor industry played a central part in Britain's industrial past. Bentleys, Aston Martins and Rolls Royces, like this one, are just some of the classic cars to have been built in the UK. Hi Stephen. Hi Carmen. Stephen Vokins is a classic car expert. He works at the museum, and sometimes gets to drive these cars. What a great job you have! It is a great, great job! So tell me about this car. This car is a 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost Alpine Eagle, known at the time as probably the finest motor car in the world. What makes it so special? Well it was made by traditional craftsmen, handmade using the finest materials available regardless of cost. Well, can we go for a spin? Yes, lets. For many years only the rich could afford a motor car. Then manufacturers found cheaper ways of making cars. Motoring broke through the class barrier. Mass motoring was here for good. Britain is where much of motoring started. Famous car manufacturers like Rover, Austin and Morris made some of the best cars of the period. There were cars for driving trips in the country, families and sporty two-seaters. The British car industry has been in decline for many years, but there are some more recent classics like the Mini. This car was built in 1959 and soon became an icon. And it's still being manufactured. Cars are a popular hobby in the UK. Motor enthusiasts can belong to owners clubs, or take part in motor shows, like the Super Car event here at Beaulieu. For some these motors are dream cars! But is there a future for these petrol-guzzling classics? People are beginning to think about more eco-friendly cars. The Citroen Evie is the UK's first four-seater all electric ready to buy car. And Rachel Osborne is a proud owner. I bought an electric car because I wanted to help the environment. There's less pollution, there's no petrol, there's no fumes. I also wanted to save money. I don't have to pay for petrol, I don't have to pay for road tax and I get free parking around town. For those of us who might like something a little faster, this is the Tesla Roadster 2.5 - the latest electric car and the only one of its type. It can do an amazing zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 3.7 seconds and can travel on a full battery for 340 kilometres. Electric cars come in all shapes and sizes. Perhaps, the Tesla and the Evie will be the classic cars of the future.\n",
            "The planet's climate has constantly been changing over thousands of years. The global average temperature today is about 15°C. Scientists are worried that the planet is warming faster than ever before. The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization. If this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5°C by 2100. Scientists say we should try and stop this trend and not allow the average global temperature to rise more than 1.5°. But even a 2°C rise would be bad for us all. Now, half a degree doesn't sound like much - but it could make a big difference to the planet. A 2°C rise would mean that all the coral reefs would disappear, but a 1.5°C rise means that there would still be some. Also, 18 per cent of the insects on Earth will disappear if the temperature goes up by 2°C, compared to 6 per cent disappearing at 1.5°C. Thirty-seven per cent of people will be affected by dangerous heatwaves at 2°C. That's twice the number compared to at a 1.5°C rise. Whether it's coral reefs, crops, floods or the survival of species, scientists say everyone and everything is far better off in a world that limits the rise to 1.5°C. So, what can we do? Scientists say that carbon will have to be sucked out of the air by machines and stored underground and that these devices exist already. They also say that billions of trees will have to be planted. People should buy less meat. Of all the foods we eat, beef has the biggest impact on climate change because it produces a high amount of greenhouse gases. Also, someone suggested not buying new clothes too often, because the fashion industry is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet. And, of course, using transport that doesn't burn fossil fuels, like electric cars. It's even better to walk or ride a bike. © BBC\n",
            "Hello, my name's Sophia and this video is for the British Council LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I'm going to be taking you around London with me. It's a bit foggy and a bit chilly, but we're going to have fun. Let's go! My day started off quite early. I headed to central London for a surprise ride on the London Eye. Although the underground tube is the fastest way into central London, we decided to take the bus so we can look out the window while we were travelling. Along the way we saw many famous sights, including Westminster Cathedral, Houses of Parliament and of course - the Big Ben. Unfortunately it was a very foggy day in London, so we couldn't see very well when we were on the London Eye; we could only really see the South Bank below us and the capsule in front of us. Maybe we'll have better luck next time! The weather in London changes all the time. Just two days before, it was a beautiful day, the sun was shining and it wasn't cold at all! In London you can experience the four seasons all in one week! Even if the weather was a little bit bad, it didn't stop us from having a good time. Wintertime in London is my favourite time of the year. There are lots of Christmas trees and beautiful lights everywhere and there are also many funfairs all around London. Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is one of the most popular funfairs. After a jam-packed day of walking around and exploring, my family and I decided to eat out in one of the very many restaurants in London. London is very multicultural and we have cuisines from all over the world. So I hope you've enjoyed following me around London. Please comment below and let me know if you've ever been to London, what your favourite part is, and also let me know what you like to do where you live. Thanks again for watching, I hope you enjoyed and, until the next one, goodbye.\n",
            "To think a Roman villa stood here, eighteen hundred years ago. Just imagine This is where I live. It's a big, posh Roman villa, because my dad's got a big, posh Roman job. He's a tax collector, and it must be a really popular job, because people are always waving at him. And this is my pet, Quackus Maximus. All my friends have pets. Some have dogs, cats, geese and even monkeys. But everyone knows a duck's a man's best friend. Salad for breakfast, Quackus? This villa's brand new. It's got all the latest gear. We've got baths, hot water, glass, central heating and mosaics. We've also got a school room where I study with my own personal tutor, unfortunately. I don't really like being the only one in the class. Homework? Sorry, sir. The duck ate it! I've got to be on my best behaviour today because dad's big boss is coming to dinner. Him! Virius Lupus. He's the governor. Just look at all this amazing food we're having in his honour: dormice stuffed with pine kernels, boiled pigs' udders, snails fattened on milk, peacocks' brains and flamingos' tongues roast hare with birds' wings stuck on, so it looks like a flying horse Lucky we also have a flushing toilet. Excuse me Dad says I've got to wear my toga for dinner tonight. This could take a while! Eric! The governor's arriving! Veni, vidi, vici ready! Come on in. Thank you Oh no! Eric? Where is that son of mine? Oof good job the Romans had central heating!\n",
            "Hello, everybody. My name is Dr Mwoombola, also known as Dr Lioness. I'm a rapper in Namibia as well as a medical intern, currently interning at Windhoek, Namibia, Katutura Hospital. So currently in Namibia, we do have a lockdown and we have also prohibited any international flights, as well as regional flights. However, there is no curfew per se. We are ensuring that we are practising social distancing. Uh, we've also had non-essential services, um, temporarily closed and the situation does look good. It looks hopeful. Being a key worker in Namibia during this time, when we are faced with the difficulty of a new virus, we doctors are really, really, you know, pressured with, um, double shifts. And when other doctors go into isolation, we are more than happy to fill in the spots because our priority are the patients. Please do read credible sources, for example the World Health Organization. They have regular updates, where you could be updated, and it's very important that you do not read any sources that aren't credible because this could provide an area of misunderstanding and misinformation that's been spread. So, a lot of people know me as Dr Mwoombola in the hospital, but when I do come home, I really unwind and become Lioness and also become Latoya. And usually what I'll be doing is that I'll either be on the internet doing some music research, finding out ways on how I can monetise my, my music. Um, I usually reply to my fans more often, I thank them as usual. I also encourage them to take part in some challenges that I might have, using some hashtags. I think now we are so connected to each other, just in a bit more digital way. So to everybody, especially the youngsters at home, currently now, I know that we're all missing our family, our friends. Just be encouraged to know that this will soon be over. Our lives will go back to normal and we'll just look at the world in a totally different way. © BBC\n",
            "Every resort town in the US has a candy store, but one store in Pismo Beach, California, goes beyond the usual taffy and caramel apples. If Hotlix has its way, Americans will be snacking on everything from caterpillars and cockroaches to mealworm-covered apples. Larry Peterman is a candyman on a mission. For more than a decade he's been promoting a valuable food source that most Americans find revolting. In a land of plenty, people resist. Larry knows why. From an early age, parents teach children to avoid insects. In our culture, from the time that we're really small, we're taught to avoid insects. They might bite you like a mosquito, or just swat them. This has got a good cricket in it! But kids aren't the only ones munching on bugs. Around the world, more than 1,400 insect species show up on menus. Insect eating, or entomophagy, is part of healthy diets in Asia, Africa, Australia and Latin America. This trend is anything but new. Archaeologists have found evidence of it dating to the earliest humans. Advocates of insect-eating like to note that it's environmentally sound. Producing a pound of caterpillar takes a tenth of the resources needed to produce a pound of beef. And insects brim with vitamins and minerals. But despite all the benefits, most Americans can't stomach bugs. Welcome, welcome, welcome! Have a seat! Unlike Larry Peterman, who celebrates them at his dinner parties. The evening begins with Larry's version of the classic shrimp cocktail. We've just finished preparing a cricket cocktail. It's a lot like a shrimp cocktail, only instead of shrimp we use crickets. OK, folks, here's the first course! Now, enjoy! While you're enjoying this, I'm going down and I'll get your next course. The main course is a stir-fry, with a special garnish. Here we go! Dinner is served! Get ready OK uno, dos three go! Several courses later, Larry presents his pièce de résistance. OK! Here it is, folks! What you've been waiting for! Oh no! Now, don't let anybody dive in until everyone's been served, please! We call it a Pismo Surfer. What it is is a banana with whipped cream, and a really good cockroach on it. You don't have to eat the wings, you don't have to eat the head, unless you want to. Do you know where this cockroach has been? How does it taste? We can do another one next week if you like! Larry predicts he'll eventually win people over. As we become more and more insect food-oriented, our tastes are going to change, and so I see a niche for somebody that does gourmet insects. Could have some snob appeal, like people taste flies and, 'Mmm, this is good. Hey, this bug is good!'\n",
            "This chilli comes from Bangladesh, originally, and it's called the ghost chilli. And this is its British relative, the Dorset Naga. And this comes in at an eye-watering, mouth-burning one million Scoville heat units! But we're now going to test its effects. I'm not even going to touch this thing! I'm going to put a glove on. And now, do you fancy a big one, Adam, or shall we go for a small one? Maybe the smallest one you can find on there. So, how are you feeling, Adam? That's quite hot! I can smell it from here! Chillies contain capsinoids, a kind of chemical. Now, each chilli has a different mix of these chemicals and the ghost chilli what happens is it takes a while for it to get to its worst effect, actually, Adam you know, it's going to get quite a lot worse. I should have mentioned that before, shouldn't I? But no. It's much more fun this way, isn't it? Very hot, are you hot? Yes, you feel quite hot! Unlike Adam, who's suffering, Barry loves chilli! So why is it that Barry can eat chillies but Adam can't? Do you know why you've been picked on, Adam? No! Well, the reason is that Adam ends up crushing the chillies with his molar teeth, and that means that it stops the seeds - thank you, Barry! - it stops the seeds spreading. So, the chilli doesn't like Adam very much, as you can possibly tell, and it's exacting its revenge. Now, Barry swallows the seeds whole, and in fact he actually does better than that because he can poo them out somewhere far away, and that means that the chilli can use Barry to spread its seeds. So, the chilli likes Barry and hates Adam. So, I think actually we'd better let you go and put your head in a bucket of yoghurt or something. But don't worry, there's only another two hours of suffering and then you'll start to feel better. So, thank you very much, Adam. We'll let you go and recover!\n",

That's the third time the taps have leaked this month. Just look at them. I'm fed up with living here. Ashlie's flat is falling apart. She's always repairing things. I hate this flat! I can't stand the kitchen. I can't bear pink. I want to move out! That's a great idea! I want to rent somewhere a bit more modern, stylish, you know? Somewhere where everything works! I know what you mean. This place, I mean, look at this, it's horrible... and it's full of old rubbish. Stephen, that's mine! Mm, really? Nice... I've decided.

Ah - well look, here's the bed, and it can also be a sofa. Do you have anything else? Yeah, I can show you something else. No... This seems better. It's got much more room, Ashlie. It's more modern. It's quite stylish. I can really see you living here. Mmm. It is quite a good size. And the kitchen's quite big. I like the carpet. No pink in sight! What's it like round here? I don't know the area very well. Er It's really close to the train station. There's trains every ten minutes into Central London. I've got the paperwork with me. You could move in tomorrow.

            "The Chinese introduced oriental food to Britain. But before the Chinese, immigrants from all around the world came to live in London. British people enjoy a huge range of food and flavours from other countries. This is Borough Market, London's oldest food market. Today, you can find food here from all over the world. This is Italian cheese. Each group of settlers brought their own food and styles of cooking and people here embraced the exciting new flavours maybe, because British food wasn't very good. Restaurants from all around the world can be found on most British high streets. Indian, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Persian... the list goes on. But just what are the UK's favourite dishes? My favourite meal is Thai green curry. One of my favourite meals is... cottage pie with peas. My favourite food is... Chinese.. Chinese. What's my favourite meal? Still full English breakfast. This is a full English breakfast. Tomato, black pudding, sausage, bacon, egg, mushroom. A big fried breakfast might not be to everyone's taste. But in Britain, there is something for everyone. Celia Brooks Brown is a food writer and knows all about food and the future of food in the UK, today. Mmm! It looks good. What have we got here, Celia? Well, this is a British tomato salad with a Yorkshire-made sheep's cheese. And here we have a Barnsley lamb chop with new potatoes and a mint hollandaise sauce. So is this a sign of developments in British cooking? Yes, people want to know where their food comes from. Chefs in restaurants like these are reinventing classic British dishes. They're using ingredients that are locally sourced and locally grown. So what about world cuisine? Well anything goes. Chefs love to experiment with ingredients from different cultures. And we live in a globalised society. It's very exciting. OK Celia, if you were cooking these dishes at home, what ingredients from different cultures would you use? Well, I might use something like this. This is a Moroccan spice mix called Ras el Hanout. Have a sniff. Hmm. That's really strong. Lovely, isn't it? Now, this might make a lovely spice rub for that lamb chop. I can't wait to taste this. The food in Britain reflects the many different cultures here. But some of the old favourites are here to stay.

And that means we've got lots of work to do, starting with these apples and pumpkins. Yes, but before that we need to get our costumes. Nice pumpkin, by the way. Looks just like you!

But I think it'll take a little more than a costume to turn you into a wizard! Yeah, I've been thinking about that. They actually sell magic tricks here. I reckon I should learn a few. You know, to help with the character. I think it may be a little harder than you think. Magic takes a lot of practice. I'm a natural. Come on, let's have a look and see what they've got. Hmm. And I'll need a wand, of course. Err, are you sure you have enough there? I think so. Look, I've got my wand! What's that? So, do you think he'll be able to do any of these tricks? Well, it does require a lot of practice. And of course you also have to read the instructions very carefully. Oh dear. It takes a lifetime to be good magician. Hear that, Stephen? What? It takes a lifetime to become a magician. Oh, I don't need to be a full magician. I'm a trainee. I'll be on to the big stuff in no time: catching a bullet, sawing a lady in half, disappearing lady. That reminds me, I may need an assistant. Don't even think about it! Come on, we need to get home so we can start preparing for the party. And I need to start practising. Hazam Falam, take me home! Err, OK. Maybe we'll get the bus. Put the lid on. Abracadabra, ta-da! Ash, I think this trick might be broken. Nothing's happening. Are you sure you're reading the instructions properly? Maybe my wand's broken. OK. Well, you can't spend all afternoon on this. We have work to do. We have a party tonight. OK, just give me ten more minutes. I need to make this work. OK. What's this? Oh, well, that was easy. Yeah, dead easy. OK. Ten more minutes. I'm going to start on the food. Stephen, I said ten minutes. You need to come and help now. What? Oh, Stephen!\n",
            "It's Hallowe'en and we're getting ready for our very own Hallowe'en party. All our friends are coming and everyone will be in fancy dress. We have to prepare all the traditional Hallowe'en food and drink. We have to decorate the house and get ourselves ready. Right, that's it. Oh, Stephen, it's some trick or treaters. You go. I have to get Poppy ready. Trick or treaters? Great! I can show them some magic. That will be a treat! Poppy! Trick or treat! Aha! Now, for your entertainment - a show of magic! Trick or treat? An empty pan. Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside. Look, mister. Give us a treat or we'll play a trick on you. Hocus Pocus! That's rubbish! Hang on a minute. Abracadabra! Hey! Ash! It worked. My trick worked! Yeah, whatever, Stephen. No, seriously, look. Hocus Pocus! Wow! Very impressive. But it did work. Yeah, yeah, now come on. Help me with my costume. I need to get my witch's nose on. Really, Ash? I thought you already had it on. Ha ha. Nice costume! Oh, thanks, it took me ages to make. Yours is great too. Thank you, but we cheated. We didn't have time to make costumes, so we just hired them. They look great anyway. I had to make loads of costumes today. I took my brother and his friends trick or treating and I made loads of ghost costumes. How did it go? Yeah, they got loads of sweets and treats and they didn't have to do any tricks. Hey listen, talking of tricks, Stephen's magic is pretty bad. He's really sensitive, so you just have to pretend to be amazed. I don't think the show will last long. Ooh, here we go. Remember, look amazed. Now, ladies and gentlemen, for my first trick of the evening I require an assistant. Ooh, I think that may be more trick or treaters. Let's go and see. Trick or treat! Don't you look scary! What have you come as? I'm a scary pumpkin. And I'm a skeleton. You're a skeleton? You're very scary. Now, an ordinary handkerchief, a simple wave... Go on then, you can have a treat, help yourselves. Go on, tuck in guys. A wave of my magic hand... Your dog's really sweet. Thank you. Do you want to give her a little stroke? Her name's Poppy. She loves dressing up for Hallowe'en as well. And Abracadabra! A treat for you all. I hope you enjoyed my show! Thank you! Happy Hallowe'en! Ashlie, I did it. It was amazing! Everything worked! Did you see it? Yeah. Well done you. It was brilliant. I told you I could do it. I could make a career out of this! I want the fire of death trick next. It's really cool. Err, maybe a little practice first, eh? Here, let's take the plates into the kitchen.\n",
            "In Victorian times, Britain was famous for producing things; it was known as 'the workshop of the world'. I'm travelling to York to find out how this industrial past is still important for a newer industry: tourism. Before planes, trains and cars, this was one of the best ways to travel. Rivers and canals played a very important role during the Industrial Revolution. Barges like this were the lorries of their day, transporting coal to the factories and finished products around the country. Now they're used for leisure and many canals have become a focus for cafés, restaurants and art galleries. Thank you for the lift. Thank you. Bye-bye. Steam trains replaced the canal boats and became great symbols of Britain's industrial past. And they're still attracting tourists from around the world today. There is a huge collection of them here at the National Railway Museum. The museum has its own work shed where engineers restore these incredible machines to their former glory. Chris, how much work goes into restoring these trains? Well, there's a lot of work involved. We work on them virtually every day, repairing them and maintaining them to make sure they can operate properly and safely. Why is it important to keep them and show them? Basically, it's important educationally to show the young generation of how railways used to operate in older days, so it's a link from the past that's brought to life in present day. Like so much of Britain, these streets are full of history. This is the old part of the City of York. Tourists love to come and experience this historic area. I think visitors come to Britain because of the shopping and the history. It is actually a very nice country, you know. Lots of historical places in Britain. I think visitors come to Britain for the culture, for the historic sites and because it's different from anywhere else in the world. Near to York Castle, there's a museum that's created a street from the past. Wow, this is like stepping back in time! I'm actually in a Victorian street museum. Visitors come here to travel back around 130 years. Natalie Kingston is a guide here and dresses up for her role. Why do you think people like to visit this old street? I think people like to visit this street because it recreates the past. It was the first ever recreated street in the world. It was built in 1938. What reactions do you get to being dressed up? The most common reaction to being dressed up is that people want to take photos of you and they like to have photos taken with you. People ask a lot more questions when you're dressed up. Not just about the costume, but also about the street and everything in it. Being here, I really do feel like I've been transported back in time.\n",
            "There is a moment when you have to choose whether to be silent or to stand up. Tonight Malala remains in intensive care. She was shot in the head for daring to suggest girls should go to school. Me and my wife, we cried all the night. The doctors told me, she will survive but she may not be the same as she was. They shot me on the left side of my head. They thought that the bullet would silence us. I am the same Malala! I'm still seventeen, I'm still a teenager. Malala's younger brother: She's still a little bit naughty, little bit that much... Who would you have been if you were just an ordinary girl from the Swat Valley? I am still an ordinary girl but if I had an ordinary father and an ordinary mother then I would have two children now. This is my youngest brother, he's a really good boy. This is the laziest one. My father said, 'have you forgiven them?' You've never felt angry? No! I want people to learn from the experience I had. very nice to see you! Nice to see you. A woman is more powerful than men! In this new school, it's hard. Physics sixty one per cent. Do you think you could ever ask a boy out on a date? Ha ha ha Roger Federer You like him? Ha ha ha. I like his haircut.

            "Good morning. Today I'll be experiencing a taste of the future. From the latest in home design to incredible gadgets, I'll be looking at how we could be living in the future. A hot shower is a great start to the day, but this is no ordinary shower. It's using rain water collected from the roof and heated by solar energy, or heat from the sun. I'm surrounded by some of the most modern houses in the world. Each one has been built as an experiment; designed to test the latest technology and ideas for living. Some of these houses can evolve as people's lives change. Thinking of having more housemates? Just add on another layer - like children's building blocks. Peter White is the Marketing Manager of the Innovation Park, where the houses are built. Peter, are these houses really a glimpse of the future? They are. In the next few years, we'll be living in houses that look like this. Just how much do they vary from ordinary houses? In some ways they're very similar. The kitchen, the bathrooms, the televisions are just like now but the technology in the houses makes them much more energy efficient. You may have seen the next invention in the movies, and it could mean no more lost keys in the future. It's called fingerprint recognition technology. And it lets you back in. Now this control panel is the brain of the house. You can set the temperature, and the shutters close automatically when it's hot outside. And this is one of my favourites: you get to control the music in every part of the house. So how about a bit of this... Or... maybe we should go for this... Now, can you guess what this is? It redefines the simple... chair. This rocks - literally. And it's a library as well. So I can grab my favourite book and just sit back and relax. I think I could spend some time here. So would you mind coming back a little later? I asked some people who are interested in house design what they would like to see in the house of the future.Woman 1: I would love a self-cleaning house. I'd like an eco-house that uses renewable energy and doesn't impact on the environment. I'd like a device that could carry me up to bed when I feel tired. I'd like a house where I could watch the football in every room. In my house of the future, I'd like a robot man that I can turn off. It's time to relax, and my favourite programme, Word on the Street, is about to start - and on a solar-powered TV!\n",
            "Over the Easter period Irish people will tuck into millions of these, but have you ever wondered how an Easter egg is made? Let's find out Natasha, thanks a million for having us. You're more than welcome. Thank you very much for coming. And can you tell us a little bit about the factory? Sure, the Chocolate Warehouse is part of Caffrey's. We opened in 1948. My grandfather opened up Caffrey's. Umm, it's now a third generation-run family business and the Chocolate Warehouse was opened eleven years ago. And is Easter a particularly busy time of the year? It's our busiest time of the year - it's Christmas, New Year, everything all rolled into one. So, where does chocolate come from? It comes from a tree called the cocoa tree, and the very first thing that starts to grow on a cocoa tree is a very beautiful pod, called the cocoa pod. Now, inside these pods are little brown beans called cocoa beans, and then we heat these, we crush them down, and we make them into different types of chocolate, for example, milk, dark and white chocolate. There's a different process for each. Then we pour them into different types of moulds. We have rabbit moulds, Easter egg moulds, handmade chocolate moulds. There's many different types of moulds, and this is how we make Easter eggs and different types of chocolate bunnies. So, you put the mould into the chocolate, to fill it. You put the lid back over. Then we put on something called a spinning machine, where the mould spins around, and this is where you make hollow or moulded products. We're open till five o'clock on Saturday for the Easter bunny, and then from the 23rd of April right through the whole summer we have chocolate workshops, great for birthday parties or school tours. You can just come up for two hours to make your own chocolates and it's great fun. Well, thanks very much for having us. Happy Easter! Thanks.\n",
            "You've got to turn up. For years, women were shut out with no say in who would lead them. Women in Saudi Arabia were only given their right to vote in 2015. But when they do get a fair chance, it can have a big impact. India's big election in 2019 saw the same percentage of women voting as men, for the first time, helping to elect more female members of parliament than ever before. Take inspiration from role models. We all want someone to look up to and it's no different in politics. New Zealand was the first country to give women the right to vote. And their current prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is only the second elected world leader to give birth while in office. She was the youngest female prime minister in the world when she was elected. But now that's Finland's 34-year-old Sanna Marin. Ms Ardern is actually the third woman to run New Zealand. Those previous prime ministers have carved a path for me that I'm incredibly grateful for. Now she wants to inspire more girls to lead, because even when one woman is elected, it doesn't solve the problem. Targets can help. Setting targets can be controversial. But lots of countries have introduced them to bring more equality. Rwanda in Africa has the most women in parliament, but it wasn't always like this. Back in the 1990s, women only made up a small share of their parliamentary seats. So in 2003, the country set a goal: to make 30 per cent of their elected politicians women. And it's worked. Today, they make up nearly two-thirds of the Rwandan parliament. Even though not everyone thinks quotas like Rwanda's are the best solution, it's hard to argue that they don't make a difference.\n",
            "The last 20 years have seen a huge increase in the Chinese economy, thanks partly to Christmas trees. The tradition of Christmas trees is believed to have begun in Germany around the 18th century, but it was Queen Victoria who made them fashionable in Britain when she was pictured standing next to one with her family in 1846. This factory in Suzhou makes sheng dan shu, as they call them, in all sorts of sizes. And this is how they produce a two-metre-high version. The branches start out as flat strips of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC to you and me. The reels are unravelled and as they pass through rollers they're bonded and stick together. Then a circular blade slices through the PVC, shredding it and making the needles. The shredded PVC is twisted around a metal wire and then pulled through a small coil. This separates the needles and makes them nice and bushy. These machines produce branches measuring around six metres long. A tree with branches this big isn't very practical, so they're cut to size by hand. They're cut this way because a mechanical cutting machine would flatten the needles back down. A bunch of branches are then sewn together using a polypropylene twine, and the sharp edges are bent over to stop little children hurting themselves as they hang their baubles from the tree. Now all that's left to do is attach the branches to the metal trunks of the tree and it becomes one of the one million sheng dan shu that are made here at this factory in China. Happy Christmas!\n",
            "This is how to do a backspin! Hi, I'm Roxy, and I'm going to show you how to do a backspin. First things first. Make sure you've got a smooth floor, and you might want to wear a slippery jacket. So, we're going to start on the floor with your legs split, like this. Next, you kick your bent leg in a circular motion, and at the same time you're going to lean back. You want to make sure that you're very high on your back, in between your shoulder blades. Keep practising that move until you can get enough speed to get a little spin. So, lie on your side and kick your leg all the way round to get spinning. The last thing you need to learn is the tuck. So, once you're on your back and you've done about half a spin, you're going to pull your knees into your chest and have your feet up to the ceiling. So, to backspin, kick your leg around, roll onto your shoulders, and tuck in your legs to spin like a record. After lots of practice, if you want to go faster, you need to kick your leg harder and push off of your right hand as you lean into it. And that's how you do a backspin!\n",
            "Can you see that the bubbles pop as soon as I tried to touch them? That's because when we touch a bubble with our dry hands, we break the bubble's surface tension. Our hands have a little bit of oil in them, and that keeps them nice and soft. But soap loves oil - that's why we use it to clean dirty, oily dishes. So when a soap bubble lands on our oily hands, those soap molecules try to take the oil away. But this bursts the bubble. So what can I use to try and help me catch a bubble without it bursting? I'm going to use a glove. Now let's see what happens! Wow! The glove is stopping the soapy bubble mixing with the oil on my hands, which means I can catch the bubble, and even bounce it! Wow!\n",
            "What have you got for the picnic, Stephen? I've got chocolate biscuits, crisps and cake. Everything kids like to eat! I've got juice, fruit, carrot sticks. Food that is good for kids! Yuk! It's summer holidays and we're going to the beach today. All this food is for our picnic lunch. We're going to take our little cousins, Ellie and Joe. We're looking after them for the day as their parents are busy. I'm really looking forward to it. It's a lovely day, it's going to be great fun. I've got my bucket and spade for sandcastles and a beach ball. Is that for the children to play with or you? You're a big kid, aren't you! I love playing ball on the beach - it's great fun! And are you just going to sit under a brolly, reading a book? Well, I think I might need an umbrella, but not for the sun. The weather doesn't look too good. I hope it doesn't rain or we won't be able to go. It's not going to rain - it's summer! Stop worrying. Come on, let's go pay for all this food. The traffic is terrible! Look at this traffic jam. We're going to be stuck here for ages. You alright, kids? I know. I think everyone's had the same idea as us. They're all heading to the beach. You know what? What? I think it's going to rain. Ashlie, don't be such a pessimist. We've Ash - is that fog? I think it is. You're right, it's fog. This is ridiculous. It is supposed to be summer. Don't worry, I think it's clearing up look. Is that hail? I don't believe it. So much for the British summer!Stephen: Hail never lasts long. I'm sure it will pass over. It's so loud I can hardly hear you. What did you say? I said that... Listen, the hail's stopping. Thank goodness. Well, at least the weather can't get any worse. It's raining now! We're going to get soaked. That's it! It's pouring with rain! There's no way we can go to the beach today. I'm sorry, Ellie and Joe. I'm afraid we're not going to make it there today. It wouldn't be much fun in the rain anyway. But what else can we do with the kids? Well, we could try that new sports centre? You know, the one with the indoor sports, like the climbing wall and bowling? Could try that. That's a great idea. What do you think, kids? I think the sun's coming out Yeah - it's definitely brightening up. Typical! Here we are, kids, a picnic feast! We have... some fruit, some fruit juice, some carrots. What would you like? All of this food is really good for you and I'm sure your mum and dad would be pleased we're giving you all healthy food. I don't like that stuff. Have you got any crisps or cake? What about chocolate biscuits? Stephen, where's all the cake, chocolate and biscuits? I got a bit hungry in the car. What? Have you eaten all of it? All the chocolate, all the cake and all the biscuits? I got very hungry in the car! Stephen!\n",
            "OK, what are we going to do next? I know Ellie wants to go snowboarding and Joe wants to go on the climbing wall. Well, I've got a good idea. Why don't Ellie and I go snowboarding, and you and Joe go on the climbing wall. What do you think, kids? Sounds good! Great! We're here at an indoor sports centre with our cousins Ellie and Joe. We were going to the beach, but it's raining, so we've come here instead. That's the British summer for you! But this is a great place to do fun sports inside. Come on then, let's go and have some more fun. We'll see you guys later. Bye! You need to be fit to be a good climber. I know I'm going to be good at this, so if you're not sure what to do, just watch me. Don't we need to get the climbing gear on? Oh yes, of course... Excuse me. Hi! We need some rope. Hi, guys. Have you climbed before? Well, Joe's new to all this so he could do with some help, but I'm a quick learner, so don't worry about me. Well, let's get you in some gear. Some harnesses. Your right leg goes through the right hole and your left leg goes through the left hole. Pull this up to your waist for me. There you go. OK, what's this for? It's to keep you safe. We're going to fix the rope to the end of the harness and stop you from falling. Come on, Joe, let's give it a go. Don't be scared, just follow me. I know I'm going to be a good climber. Oh, oh, and we turn! Oh no! Here I go! Here I go! How do I stop? That was awesome! And you're so good at this, Ellie! Thanks! So are you. But I'm freezing. I know! It is so cold. It's a bit different from a day at a beach, but great fun! Shall we have another go? Yeah. I might try turning next time. Come on then, I'll race you to the top. Fantastic, Joe! Just move your right foot up to the next hold. Just one more step. I made it! I made it to the top! OK, Stephen, I just want you to move your right hand up to the next hand hold. I can't. I can't move! It's OK, Stephen, just don't look down. What do you mean don't look down? How can I not look down? OK, Stephen, just calm down. We've got you on the line. You're going to be fine. Don't be scared, Stephen! I'll come and help. Don't be scared? I'm terrified! Help! Ashlie! Get me down!\n",
            "Your videos are amazing. I started watching them and then I'm just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling... Hannah, with the help of your honesty about cerebral palsy, how do you think it'll change how people see it? Hopefully, people will see that I have cerebral palsy, but cerebral palsy does not have me. By doing our TikToks, we hope that inclusion will become a part of everyday life. How does a blind girl get around parked cars on the pavement? Why did you even start making TikTok videos? I saw that Learn on TikTok was actually trending and I thought, right, I'm going to show the world that being blind is really cool and I'm going to tell everyone what I do in my day-to-day that makes the world really accessible to me. I think the aim was to just have fun, but then as we grew bigger we realised there was a need for people to see how disabilities are in society. So I think we just then did it to raise awareness. I can imagine, like, loads of people have questions as well. Yeah, oh my gosh, loads of questions. Um, how do you pick up your guide dog's poop? Which is, you know, funny. I did show that one. But the response has been so amazing. Having a disability can be really positive and I am so disability confident and I think everyone else should be. And those are the comments that I do receive, it's amazing.\n",
            "Hey guys! My name is Asha and this video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and YouTube channel. It is International Women's Day and I basically just wanted to make a really short video promoting girl power and just expressing how much I'm proud to be a female myself - and I'm not just saying that because I have no other choice but to be a female. I feel like it's a day to uplift women - females - not to bring each other down, which in some cases can happen. Sometimes, even I'm guilty of this you can feel inferior from other women, whether they're doing better than you at school or work even on YouTube I would think and look at someone and I would be like, 'How has she got so many subscribers when I've only got this many?' But to be honest, we all have our own journeys. That person probably has worked just as hard. But instead of spreading rumours or knocking them down about how successful they have been, we should empower each other. So, go out there and compliment someone - whether that's your mum, your sister, someone on the street, your friends You can even go onto Instagram, Twitter - tweet your favourite celebrity and just tell them how well they are doing. Because, honestly, a compliment is not going to ruin a day and 99 per cent of the time it will probably enhance their day and literally make their day. You could make someone's day. So, what I want you to do when this video ends is to go out and I want you to compliment someone who is a female and say how well they're doing at work, school that you like their nice jumper! I think spreading positivity is such an important thing. But that is all for now. It was just a really quick video just to say, Happy International Women's Day. If you like this video, make sure you give it a thumbs up. Comment down below, what compliment you have given recently to another fellow female and, do you know what, even male because we are nice people. Do not forget to subscribe and I will see you in the next video. Byeeeeeeeeee!\n",
            "I've experienced bullying! I've experienced bullying! I've experienced bullying! I've experienced bullying! I've experienced bullying! In school I was bullied because I looked different. I was made fun of because I couldn't run as fast as the other kids. The people who bullied me were my friends. But I was pushed and called names. A girl in my class turned all my friends against me. Being bullied made me feel kind of insignificant. Horrible and sad and lonely. Bad, like being myself was wrong. It made me feel like no one liked me. And it also made me feel really upset. And made me question: why was it happening to me? Are they saying this as a joke or are they saying this cos they really don't like me? Do they really hate me? And I felt like there was no way out. And that I was completely alone, which wasn't true. In the end I told a teacher and I stopped hanging out with them. I spoke to my parents. Distancing myself from the bullies was probably the best decision that I've made. Because I didn't want their negative energy to affect me any more. If you're experiencing bullying... or you know someone who is... speak up. Get support. Don't let it get locked up in here. Surround yourself with friends and family. People care about you. Talk to a parent, teacher or trusted adult about how you are feeling. And you'll find once you tell, it'll start to get better. There's loads more information about tackling bullying on the CBBC website. What do we think about bullying, Cotton? Not much!\n",

            "Hello, everybody. My name is Joe Wicks, The Body Coach, and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about why I think it's so important to stay fit and active and to exercise when you can at home. Now, first of all, exercise, no matter whether you're five years old, 50 years old, it always makes you feel happy. It lifts your mood, it gives you energy, it makes you fit and strong, and so it really is something you should try and do every single day. And I'm now going to share with you some of my favourite exercises which you can do at home with no equipment, so you can do it in your living room, your bedroom, on a tiny little bit of carpet. So here's my top five home exercises. Good luck and give them a try. Exercise number one, one of my favourites, nice and simple, you can do 30 seconds, running on the spot. Nice and quick. Brilliant. Lift those knees up. As quick as you can. Pump the arms. Back nice and straight. Thirty seconds of running on the spot. Brilliant. Now rest. All right, next exercise, one of my second favourites, nice and simple, it's called jumping jacks. So it's hands above the head for 30 seconds of jumping jacks. You can do it in a circuit. Do 30 seconds of running, rest for 30 seconds, and then go into our second exercise, jumping jacks. Perfect. Right Exercise number three, one for the lower body, so good for strengthening the legs, it's going to be squats, where you sit down and stand up tall. So 30 seconds, squats. Down and up. Brilliant. Sitting into the chair, imagine a chair behind you. Sit down, stand up. Do as many as you can in 30 seconds. Perfect. So the last couple of reps... and you're now gonna rest. OK, next one. Number four, punches. So arms up like this, as if you're gonna punch a punching bag, nice fast punches, 30 seconds, really quick punches, as quick as you can. Good, come on nice and fast. Thirty seconds. Really stretch, reach. Five, four, three, two, one, and relax. Brilliant! Fifth exercise. Another great one for the legs, we call a lunge. So we're going to start with our feet together. Do a reverse lunge and then we alternate so you bring the feet together. Step back, step forwards. If you want to make it harder, you can do this. Look, you jump. Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump and relax. There you go. Well, that's my five exercises. Hope you enjoyed them. Do each one for 30 seconds, then rest, and do the whole thing three times and that would be a great little home workout to get you feeling energised, feeling full of life and feeling great. So thanks again, good luck and stay positive. Keep smiling.\n",
            "Hi, my name is Rosa and I'm 12 years old. Hi, my name is Yarah and I'm 14 years old. Hi, my name is Norah. I'm also 14 years old. We are twins. And we are Let It Happen from the Netherlands. How long have you been dancing for? We have been dancing our whole lives because our parents just love music and we really grew up with it at home, and as long as I can remember we were dancing, so for a very long time now. What's your favourite kind of music to dance to? We really love to mix things up, because we love sometimes to dance on soul music, but the other day we liked, like, African music and then hip-hop music, so we really love, like, the combination of different styles. Yeah. What would be the highlight of your dance career so far? We live, like, really in a small town and we would never imagine we'd be noticed, like, in the US, yeah, like on ellen, and that was so cool. It was like, I really felt like a celebrity, because she treated us, like, so well. So they picked us up from the hotel and then get, like, this very fancy car. Yeah, and it was like, for a moment before we had to perform I was super nervous, but, you know, when we danced there, yeah, it was so nice. Is there a celebrity that you would love to dance with? We would love to dance with Beyoncé. Yeah. Beyoncé isn't here right now, but you have me instead. So, can you teach me some moves? Bye, Newsround.\n",
            "This is London's West End, where theatre is centre stage. Over 40 playhouses can be found in the largest theatrical district in the world. The Prince of Wales Theatre is home to the hit show Mamma Mia!. And I'm getting a sneak peek backstage. Mamma Mia! has been playing at the Prince of Wales Theatre since 2004. It's a love story set on a Greek island. The show features hit songs by the band ABBA. It's been a worldwide hit, winning many awards. This is the warm up, when the actors get ready for the show. I can't wait to see them in their full costumes in the actual performance. I think this is the way to the dressing room. Ah, now this one is so me. I've come backstage to meet one of the stars of the show. Craig, which character do you play? I play Sky who is getting married to Sophie, who is Donna's daughter, who runs the taverna on the island. Tell me about the costumes. I'm mainly in a wetsuit or swimming trunks and everyone else is in normal clothes throughout - except right at the end, when we do the big finale, everyone gets dressed up in big, glittery, loud colour costumes. What's the best thing about working on Mamma Mia!? The crew and cast are great. And the music's great. There are a lot more people involved in putting on a show than just the actors. Without the backstage crew, the show can't go on. Clare Whitfield is a stage manager and has worked on Mamma Mia! since 1999. So Clare, tell me about what you do. My job is to look after the show from the set and the props and the furniture to ensure the safe and clean running of the production every night. Can you explain what a prop is? Yes, a prop is just an everyday object that the actors use. In our show we use a lot of luggage, a diary, letters, a hairbrush. It can be anything, but the fact that the actor picks it up and takes it on stage makes it a prop. Why do people enjoy Mamma Mia!? Everyone loves ABBA. People of all ages can relate to it. And it's such a great, uplifting story. It's almost time for the show to start. I'd better go and find my seat.\n",
            "I want to talk about something I saw in the British Council that is very weird to me. My name is Jannie. I've been working in the British Council Hong Kong for nearly two years. This is a comfy place to work because it's very modern, the building, it's clean and we've got sunshine from outside the window. And surrounding us there are different international, big hotels and they are like Shangri-la, Conrad. And it's like a business area here, an ordinary office area. Last Sunday I saw a very strange thing here. We were having lesson with the children - they are four years old and we were in a very big classroom. And because it's very big, so we separated it into two areas. That means we have got two classes there, two teachers and two different groups of children. We started to have the lesson as usual, singing, playing and asking them if they are well that day. And suddenly the teaching assistant from next door came into my classroom and screamed, saying that 'There is a pig! There is a pig!' The teacher looked at me and I looked at the teacher - we were like, 'What? What's going on?' And then so we left the classroom, we went into the next classroom and then we saw a real pig! It's a wild pig, we believe, and it's very big. It is black in colour and I can't believe I could see a pig in - outside the British Council, in such a business centre in Admiralty here. So all the children were very excited to look at the pig and we were so close with the pig, and it's like the pig was just outside the window, in the garden outside, and we were behind the window inside the classroom. And because of the children, they were so excited and they were screaming and patting the window and screamed 'Piggy, piggy, piggy!' And then we were like, I think we did something that made the pig excited as well. It started to use its very flat big nose to hit the window. It's like trying to enter the classroom, to have lesson with us. And we messed around for about ten minutes and then maybe the pig started to feel bored and so it left the window, walked away. And another strange thing is the pig walked upstairs to another garden because the garden outside is separated into two different areas, downstairs and upstairs. So it walked upstairs. And it's very strange to me! So after the pig left us, we went back to our classroom and then we had our lesson again, but it's like we all can't calm down and we were thinking about the piggy, the piggy and the children were screaming 'piggy, piggy' and then, it was a very interesting day.\n",
            "Belfast is a lively and exciting city known for its music, nightlife and university. But it was once famous for something which made headlines around the world. Years of conflict known as the Troubles left thousands dead. One community, who are mostly Protestant Christians, wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. The other community, who are mostly Catholic Christians, wanted it to join up with the Irish Republic. People on the extremes of both sides used violence. Fortunately, those days are over. But these murals are a reminder of the past. They can be found all over Belfast, painted on walls and houses. The art showed support for one side or the other and symbolised a divided community. But now many murals are being preserved as an important part of the city's history. I've come to meet Tim McCarthy. Hi there, Tim. Hello, thanks so much for meeting me. He has studied the murals and what they can tell us about the history of conflict here. Tim, can you tell me about images like this? Images like this are very common in working-class areas in Northern Ireland. And what does it tell us about the history of the area? Well, this particular community will have felt as if they were under pressure from the other community and therefore it contains a lot of defensive, militaristic kind of imagery. And what about images from the other community? You will find similar imagery, but the symbolism is very slightly different - a different use of colour but the content will be very similar. And what is Belfast city like now? Belfast is very different in the last few years. We've had a lot of investment, everyone feels better, feels more relaxed and a lot of the murals that are going up actually reflect this. New murals are appearing in the city. Many people feel these new images are more appropriate for a community which wants to leave the violent past behind. People have been working hard to achieve a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Many projects try to bring both sides closer together. Here at the Conway Community Centre, Tim is helping young people develop their skills and produce new artworks. In Northern Ireland it's very important for there to be an arts scene. Because instead of violence, instead of expressing yourself through alcohol or drugs, you can turn to the arts scene. It's safe and it's a good form of expression. I think street art is important for any city because it gives the city a kind of character. Without art in a country it would be very dull. Tim gave me a lesson in his style of street art. Tim, how significant is the street art scene in Belfast today? Well, it is quite small, but it's growing all the time with the help of the internet obviously. People can see what's happening globally and they want a little piece of that on their doorstep. There is a saying that art reflects society. People here are glad that the new art murals reflect a more prosperous and peaceful Northern Ireland.\n",
            "Come on, Ash. You said you wanted to see the scenery and you keep looking at the guidebook. Yes, it's just really interesting finding out a bit more about all the places along this coast. We're here in Northern Ireland. We both want to try surfing. And the sea you can see over there is the Atlantic Ocean. This scenery is beautiful, but lots of places here also have interesting stories. There are lots of fascinating folk tales and legends.Stephen: We're here to visit the Giant's Causeway, one of the most famous attractions in Northern Ireland. How far is it, Ash? Not far to go now. We should be there soon. Come on. Don't you think this coastline is just beautiful, Stephen? Look, it says here that the Giant's Causeway is supposed to be a bridge that was built by a giant.Stephen: You can see why people might say that. Anyway we're here for the Atlantic waves - for surfing - and I want to get down to the beach as soon as possible. Hi. We've got a surfing lesson booked. We don't have any equipment so we'll have to hire everything, if that's alright. Don't worry about it. We've got everything you need. Can you swim? Yes, we're both good swimmers. But I'm not keen on going in very cold water. Don't worry about the cold. We'll give you wetsuits that can keep you warm. And we'll get you just the right size board. Great, thank you! That looks pretty hard, Stephen. I wonder if we'll be able to stand after just one lesson? I might be able to, but you won't! Here comes the instructor. We can ask him. Hi there. We're here for our first lesson. And I was just wondering - do you think that we'll be able to stand by the end of today? Absolutely - no problem. We're going to start off with the basics of surfing and you guys are going to have a great time. That's excellent! Shall we get straight in the water, then? We're going to start off on the beach first of all, guys. First of all, you need to decide which foot you naturally put to the front. That's the foot that goes to the front of the board. Like this? Yes, that's it. Now we need to work out how you lie on the board so that you can balance properly whenever you're paddling. Once you learn how to lie down then you start learning how to stand up. OK? First of all, you guys need to put your surfboards onto the sand. I think I've swallowed half of the ocean. And I'm freezing cold too. I need a hot drink to warm me up. Come on then, I think there's a café at the top of this beach. Where did I put my money? Oh no! What's the matter, Stephen? I put my wallet in my wetsuit to keep it safe... And now my money's soaking wet!\n",
            "Right, we can have a couple of hours here before we have to head off to our hotel. We're here in Northern Ireland to learn how to surf and Ashlie's insisting we also take time to see the sights. We are at Dunluce Castle. It's famous because it's supposed to have its own ghosts. Come on - let's go see if we can find a ghost. Stephen, look! It says here that part of the castle fell into the sea during a terrible storm. All the cooks drowned except for a young kitchen boy who survived. Scary story, but what an interesting place. Here, give me that book. What's the name of our hotel? It's the Ballygally Castle Hotel. The Ballygally Castle Hotel? Ballygally Castle is said to be one of the most haunted places in the area. Come on, Stephen. We'll be fine! Hi there. We have a reservation for two rooms. The name is Walker. Ah yes. How are you enjoying Northern Ireland? Oh, it's great. We've been surfing today and we went to a haunted castle, Dunluce. We didn't see any ghosts, though. Did you know we have ghosts here in the hotel? Really? Yes, we even have a Ghost Room you can visit. The man who built the castle here trapped his wife in one of the rooms and she escaped by jumping out of the window. People who visit the hotel say they hear strange noises and things move by themselves. A Ghost Room! How do we get there? You go down the corridor, turn left and up the spiral staircase. I thought the receptionist was joking when she said the hotel had a ghost. But they really do have a haunted room. How scary is that? Oh Stephen, you'll believe anything. But I do want to see this Ghost Room. Let's have a look. I'm not sure about this, Ash. Come on, you big baby! Hmm. I don't like the look of this. Look, it's just an ordinary room. It's a bit gloomy and the bed's hard, but I would be happy to spend the night in here. Well, I wouldn't! It's cold and it's creepy. Anyway, I'm going to my room to change before we eat. Whoooo! Come on, Stephen, we don't want to be late for dinner. Oh Ash! You're so sensible sometimes. Oi! Wait for me... Wasn't that a lovely meal, Stephen? I am ready for bed - all that surfing. I'm exhausted. I'm going to sleep well tonight.Stephen: Me too. But I've found all the ghost stories a bit scary. I feel a bit nervous about spending the night in this haunted hotel, don't you?Ashlie: All these ghost stories are absolute nonsense! I don't believe in ghosts. How could you possibly believe that rubbish? Now, go to bed. Ashlie - actually, your room isn't that way. What? I had your room changed. You're in the Ghost Room. I had all your stuff sent up there. What? Well, you said all these stories were nonsense. You said you didn't believe in ghosts. Go on, Ash - spend a night in the Ghost Room. You're not scared, are you? No. I'll sleep like a log. Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't get scared! All this talk about ghosts has got me thinking the hotel is haunted! I'm as bad as Stephen! I hope he's OK.\n",
            "This is me, yeah. This is how I see the world. This is my walk and my thoughts. People look down on me. People think I'm different. People think I'm backwards. Music, man, is my passion, it's my life. Travel, I love it, it's what I'm all about. The world, I'm going to see it all. But it's not all that good. I don't like people shouting at me, pointing their fingers. I don't like it when my mum's upset. Heights, yeah? I'm well not into that. The best thing in life, yeah, it's my family; my brother, my mother and not forgetting my cat. We have these family parties, yeah, everyone's there. Then there's chilling with my friends; they are the best. But fish and chips, I can't get enough of that! But that's me, that's who I am and that's my walk.\n",
            "Come on, Stephen. I'm coming! We're going on a trip to Paris. It's a very short train ride from London and it's a chance to experience some French culture and do some shopping. Ashlie's never been to Paris before. I've been loads of times and I'm looking forward to practising my French. Come on, you. You can practise your French on the train. Paris, here we come! Avez-vous, avez-vous That's good, Stephen, good to see you making an effort. Merci beaucoup - that's 'thank you' in French. Right. So how long does it take? About two and a half hours? So we will be in Paris just in time for dinner. We can get something to eat on the train. No, let's wait until we get to Paris. French food is fantastic. I want to eat in a French café. I don't want to eat a train sandwich when I could eat a lovely French meal. OK, then. Oh, and you can order the food in French. Great, I'm going to practise. What's French for 'dinner'? Wow, here we are. Ooh, it's so exciting to be in Paris. Right, we need to get a taxi. I want to see the Eiffel Tower first and then we can have something to eat. There aren't any taxis here. Let me ask someone. Excusez-moi. Oui? Où est le taxi? Il y en a juste là-bas là. Merci. Merci. See, Ashlie, you would never have found a taxi without me. Yeah, yeah, come on! Right, now we've done some sightseeing, it's time for something to eat. What do you want, Ash? Here comes the waiter. Erm, can I have one of those, please? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Bonsoir. Je voudrais un steak-frites, deux cafés au lait et un escargots. OK. Des escargots, un steak-frites, deux cafés au lait. Erm, yes. Oui. C'est tout. Merci. That's great, Ash, he understood. Well, I certainly didn't. That's good, Stephen. It's so good to see you trying to practise your French. Well, I need to work on my pronunciation. I didn't sound very French, did I? You got the food, that's the important thing. Well done! Well, I think it's polite. You have to try and speak the language of the country you're visiting. You've got to practise if you want to learn. Yeah, I suppose you're right. What are they? They look like snails. I didn't order those! Yes, you did. That's what you pointed to in the menu. Stephen! I haven't eaten snails before. Well, try them. You might like them. Bon appétit! Hmm, they're good. But I'm going to make sure I know what I'm ordering next time - so when I go shopping, I don't make any mistakes.\n",
            "Well, that was a nice hotel. I slept really well. Me too. OK, time to see more of Paris. Is there anything especially you want to see? Everywhere! I'd love to see Notre Dame and the Arc de Triomphe. Let's go. This way, I think. C'est combien, s'il vous plaît? Merci. See, Ashlie, I told you I can make myself understood. It's all about confidence. I'm going to keep practising and I'm not going to worry about making a few mistakes. People understand me and that's the main thing. Yeah, right, and you're confident, OK. Now listen, we've done some touristy places. Now it's time to do some shopping! I read on the internet about a great area. It's where you can meet artists. It's near the river. I think it's called the Left Bank? Hey, why don't you ask someone for directions? Remember, it's all about confidence. Excusez-moi. Bonjour. Bonjour. Combien le portrait? Cent cinquante. Cent cinquante ah, a hundred and fifty euros. That's right. One hundred and fifty euros. Your French is pretty good. Thank you. Well, I'm trying my best. Your English is very good. Well, I'm French but I use English a lot. English is a really useful language. Around here there are a lot of tourists so they often speak to me in English. Yes, I guess we're lucky that some people speak English but today I'm hoping to improve my French. I need to speak more and not worry too much about making mistakes. Ah yes, you can always improve. You never stop learning. I always pick up new words talking to tourists and learning a language is so important, I think. I know what you mean. So would you like to buy a painting? I mean, voudriez-vous Thanks, but it's a bit expensive. Hi, Stephen. Oh, hi, Ash. Good luck with your practice! You too. Right, I'm almost done with my shopping. Wow, you have been busy. Yes, and my French is really improving. I bought all of these using your phrase book. I just need to get something else. I need to get something from that shop over there. Look, you wait here and I'll be back in a moment. OK, Stephen, I wanted to get you something special, something to remind you of our trip to Paris. Oh, that's nice, Ash. What's that? Oh, you look great, Stephen! Merci beaucoup. And now I know that that means 'Thank you very much' in French.\n",
            "London is famous for its vibrant art scene. It's got some of the best art galleries in the world. Among them, the National Gallery... the Tate Britain... the National Portrait Gallery and many more. They are here permanently; they are part of the London landscape. But not all our galleries are like that. Now there's a new kind of art gallery springing up or popping up in London. They're set up quickly, enjoyed for a short time, maybe a few days or a week. And then they close again. They're called pop-up art galleries. All you need is an empty building, permission from the owner, some artists and then some visitors to pop in. In London's Covent Garden a new pop-up art gallery is being organised in an empty shop by Ryan Stanier. Hi, Ryan. Hi, Joe. You alright? Yes, good. So Ryan, what are the advantages of a pop-up art gallery compared to a traditional gallery? Big, traditional galleries take on less artists when times are tough. Therefore it's a good opportunity for a younger audience to actually see emerging artists. And it's good for visitors as well. Absolutely. It's free to come in. We try and make an informal environment making it very unintimidating and a nice buying environment to buy affordable art from young artists. What can I help you with? Come inside and I'll show you. Well, welcome to the gallery. As you can see, there's still a bit left to do. Let me help you out. Pop-up galleries are an example of people creating an opportunity during economic hard times. It's a way of using buildings which would otherwise be empty. OK, so that's the hard work done. Now it's time to see what's on show. London's newest pop-up art gallery is finally open to the public. But what do they think of it? Yeah, I think it's really neat. It's a good idea. Well, I think it's a fantastic use of space. It doesn't look like it's just been put up. It looks like it could have been here for quite a while. Yeah, it's a very, sort of, you know, bright, colourful, in your face and it's a good space to sort of go in. Laura is one of the artists whose work is on display here. Laura, most of these paintings here are yours. What was it that made you want to put your art work in a pop-up art gallery? Erm, it's just a basically an excellent opportunity to be able to display work which I might not have been able to do in a more established gallery. Has it helped you as an artist? Definitely. I mean, for somebody who's not established yet, it's better to have the paintings in a shop than to have them at home still. And you sell them here, don't you? Yes. It's been a great way to bring more art to more people and no doubt another one will be popping up soon.\n",
            "'Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you really are': the words of Felix Baumgartner, who fell 128,000 feet from the edge of space. He broke the sound barrier and the record for the highest ever skydive. Millions watched nervously, perhaps none more so than the retired American fighter pilot Joe Kittinger, who set the previous record and was directing last night's attempt. Jonathan Rudman reports. Now, here we go! There's the bubble rising, there's the tail going out From start to finish it was an incredible journey, this helium balloon taking over two and a half hours to lift fearless Felix Baumgartner four times as high as the cruising height of a passenger jet. His mother down below, wondering if she'd ever see her 43-year-old son again. And from mission control, the voice of the Austrian's 84-year-old mentor speeding him on his way. Doing great, Felix, doing great in that cabin. You're doing great. Everything looks green and you're on your way to space. Twenty-four miles up, Baumgartner reads his checklist for the last time. The door to his pod opens and he releases his seat belt. Attaboy, that's good. Start the cameras! And our God and angels will take care of you. Sometimes you have to go up really high, he says, to understand how small you really are. And in the daredevil's greatest dare yet, he jumps into the void from the edge of space. He's in freefall for over four terrifying minutes, spinning supersonically through the stratosphere. Up to 834 miles an hour, faster than the speed of sound, in less than a minute. It's all being broadcast online worldwide. There's even a camera fixed to his spacesuit, though there's a 20-second video delay in case Baumgartner's blood exits from his body through his eyeballs and he doesn't survive. As planet Earth approaches, the spinning stops. The air's density slows him down. And when his parachute opens, fearless Felix begins his sweep into the history books. After the highest manned balloon flight, the first supersonic freefall and the biggest jump ever from 128,000 feet. Then, a confident touchdown, followed by relief that he hadn't died in front of his family. When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you do not think about breaking records any more, you do not think about gaining scientific data. The only thing that you want is that you want to come back alive, you know, because you do not want to die in front of your parents, your girlfriend and all these people watching this. This became the most important thing to me when I was standing out there. The stuntman says he plans to become a helicopter rescue pilot and to settle down, because nothing is likely to top the giddy heights of this. An extraordinary leap into the unknown, and head-first for much of the 24-mile journey home.\n",
            "Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, has come back from university to find that his father, the old king, is dead. His mother has married his father's brother, Claudius, who is now king of Denmark. Hamlet is shocked that his mother has married so soon after his father's death, and angry that she has married Claudius. Soon, a ghost is seen walking on the castle walls. The ghost looks like Hamlet's father, the dead king. When Hamlet sees the ghost, he is told that it is the ghost of his father. 'I am your father's spirit,' the ghost tells Hamlet. It tells him that Hamlet's father did not die naturally, but was murdered by his brother Claudius. As the king slept, Claudius put poison into his ear, causing the king a painful death. The ghost tells Hamlet to take revenge on Claudius for murdering his father. Hamlet can't believe that his mother would marry the man who murdered her husband. He becomes depressed, and he thinks about killing himself: 'To be or not to be - that is the question.' Hamlet decides to pretend he is mad while he tries to find out if King Claudius really did kill his father. Claudius soon notices that Hamlet is behaving strangely, so he asks Polonius, his adviser, to spy on him. Polonius thinks that the best person to find out what is causing Hamlet's strange moods is Polonius's own daughter Ophelia. This is because Ophelia is Hamlet's girlfriend, and so she is close to him. But when Ophelia tries talking to him, Hamlet gets very angry, tells her that he never loved her and breaks up with her. Ophelia is very upset by this. A group of travelling actors arrives in town. Hamlet gets them to perform a play at the castle. Hamlet's play contains a scene in which someone murders a king by putting poison in his ear - exactly what the ghost said had happened to him. Hamlet's plan is to watch King Claudius during the play, and see how he reacts when he sees his own crime performed on stage. Then Hamlet will know if Claudius is guilty or not. Hamlet's plan works. King Claudius becomes so angry that he interrupts the play, and goes off in a rage. Claudius starts thinking of ways to get rid of Hamlet. Soon afterwards, Hamlet sees Claudius praying, and wants to kill him. But he worries that if he does, Claudius will go to heaven, instead of going to hell, which as a murderer he deserves. So Hamlet does nothing, and goes to speak to his mother. While they are talking in his mother's room, he sees someone moving behind the curtain. Hamlet thinks that it is Claudius, so he takes his sword and stabs through the curtain. But he is shocked to find he has in fact killed Polonius not Claudius. This of course means that Hamlet has killed the father of his girlfriend Ophelia. Ophelia goes mad, and drowns herself in a river. Ophelia's brother, Laertes, comes to her funeral and is furious about what has happened. He and Hamlet argue about who loved Ophelia most, and King Claudius now sees an opportunity to finally get rid of Hamlet. He organises a sword fight between Hamlet and Laertes. To make sure that Hamlet is killed, Claudius gives Laertes a sword covered in poison. He also prepares a cup of poisoned wine. But Claudius's plans go horribly wrong when the poisoned sword wounds both Hamlet and Laertes, and Hamlet's mother drinks from the poisoned cup. Knowing that he is about to die himself, Hamlet kills Claudius, finally getting revenge for the murder of his father. At the end of the play, all of the royal household of Denmark are dead.\n",
            "Scotland is at war, and has just won a great battle. Macbeth, a general in the Scottish army, is the hero of the battle. On his way home afterwards, Macbeth and his friend meet three mysterious witches. Somehow, the witches already know Macbeth's name. They tell him that he is going to be promoted, and that he will be given more money, land and power. When they say 'Macbeth - the future king', Macbeth is confused, and doesn't really believe the witches. Soon afterwards, Macbeth receives a message from Duncan, the king of Scotland. King Duncan wants to reward Macbeth for his victory, and has decided to promote him, giving him more money, land and power. This is exactly what the witches said would happen, so Macbeth wonders if it is also true that he will become king one day. Macbeth's wife, Lady Macbeth, soon hears about her husband's success and the witches' predictions. She becomes excited about the idea of her husband becoming king, and she wants to be the queen herself. But she's worried that Macbeth won't do anything to make it happen. So she comes up with a plan to murder King Duncan, who is coming to stay at the Macbeths' castle that night. At first Macbeth doesn't like the idea, but Lady Macbeth has a very powerful personality, and is very cold-blooded. She persuades him that murdering Duncan is the best thing to do, and that she will plan everything. That night, while King Duncan is sleeping, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth make his guards drunk. When the guards are asleep, Macbeth comes into Duncan's room and kills him with a knife. Next morning, when the king's death is discovered, Macbeth kills the guards and tells everyone that he did this because they killed the king. Duncan's son Malcolm is frightened that he might be killed too, and so he escapes to England to lie low and stay safe. With Duncan dead, and Malcolm away in England, Macbeth becomes King of Scotland, and Lady Macbeth becomes Queen. But Macbeth is worried that his friends might become his enemies, and might want to kill him so that they can become king. So he hires murderers to kill his friends and their families. But now Macbeth starts imagining that he can see the ghost of his murdered friend. At dinner that night, the ghost appears to Macbeth, but no one else can see it. Macbeth behaves very strangely in front of all his guests. Macbeth goes to see the witches again, who make more predictions. But they tell him that he will be safe until a nearby forest comes to his castle. Macbeth is relieved - after all, forests obviously cannot move. Lady Macbeth is tortured by the guilt of Duncan's murder. She has started sleepwalking and thinks she can see blood on her hands. She cannot get her hands clean. She finally goes mad and kills herself. In the meantime, King Duncan's son Malcolm has actually organised an army in England to invade Scotland and punish Macbeth for killing his father. Macbeth's other enemies join with him, and the army march towards Scotland. Macbeth waits for the English army at his castle and is convinced the witches' predictions mean he's safe. But he's terrified when he hears the English army is using branches from the trees of the forest to protect themselves. He realises what this means: the forest really is coming to his castle! Macbeth is no longer safe, and he is killed in the battle. With Macbeth dead, and his head cut off, Malcolm becomes the new king of Scotland.\n",
            "In a beautiful Italian town, some local soldiers are coming back home after a war. One of the soldiers, a young man called Claudio, falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy local family. Her name is Hero and she loves him too. But her cousin, Beatrice, is not so happy about the men's return. She remembers how she always argues with Claudio's friend Benedick: she and he both like to speak their minds, and he is just as clever as she is. There's a big party to celebrate the end of the war. And soon there is another reason to celebrate! Claudio and Hero have decided to get married. But one of the guests decides to ruin things for them. He plans to trick Claudio into thinking that Hero is unfaithful to him. So he takes Claudio into a garden. From the garden, he points out Hero's bedroom window. Inside, there's a man and a woman. It's actually Hero's maid with a man-friend, but because it's dark and they can't see clearly, Claudio assumes that it's his fiancée, Hero, and that she's with another man! Meanwhile, Hero, Claudio and their friends have a plan of their own. They think that Benedick and Beatrice would make an ideal couple. They decide to help them fall in love by playing a trick on them both. First Claudio and two of his friends allow Benedick to overhear them talking about how much Beatrice is in love with him. Then Hero and her maid do the same with Beatrice - they make sure she hears them talking about how much Benedick loves her. The trick works, and Beatrice and Benedick completely fall for each other But more trouble is on the way. Claudio is both angry and upset with Hero because he still believes she's been flirting with the man he saw in her window. He waits until the wedding then accuses her of being unfaithful, in front of everybody! Hero is so shocked that she faints and falls to the floor, unconscious. Everyone thinks she's dead, and Claudio and his friends leave the church in shock. Benedick and Hero's father decide no one should know that Hero is still alive until they can prove that she hasn't done anything wrong. And Beatrice makes Benedick promise to kill Claudio for what he has done to Hero. Meanwhile, the local policeman has arrested the man who was in Hero's bedroom with the maid. The people who played the trick on Claudio have been reported. But while this is going on, Claudio still believes Hero is dead, and he's very troubled to think that it is he who has killed her. Then, when the man who was arrested is forced to confess the trick to Claudio, Claudio is very sorry for wrongly accusing Hero of being with another man. As a punishment, Claudio must publicly mourn Hero's death and tell everyone she is innocent. He is told to marry another of Hero's relatives instead. On the wedding day Claudio goes to the church but when the bride's veil is lifted and he sees the face of this mysterious woman, he realises that it's Hero and, amazingly, she has forgiven him! The lovers are so happy to be back together and Benedick and Beatrice announce that they too are going to get married later that day. There is a big party and dancing as everyone comes together to celebrate the double wedding. All's well that ends well.\n",
            "The story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Verona in Italy. Two families, the Montagues and the Capulets, hate each other so much that they fight on the street whenever they meet. One of these families, the Capulets, organises a big party so that they can introduce their daughter Juliet to a rich nobleman, Count Paris, who has asked to marry her. Juliet is nearly 14, and her parents are keen for her to marry soon. Romeo is the son of the Montague family, and is also about 14. Romeo and his friends decide that it would be exciting to go to the Capulets' party too. But they agree that they must go in disguise because if they are recognised at the party by the Capulets, they might be killed. That night, at the party, Romeo meets Juliet, and they fall in love at first sight. However, Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, recognises Romeo, knows he is from the Montague family - and wants to kill him. Romeo hides in the garden, and talks to Juliet when she appears on her balcony. They realise that they are perfect for each other, and decide to get married. The next day, they go to a priest called Friar Lawrence, who marries them in secret. Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, gets angry very easily. He starts a fight with Romeo's best friend. When Romeo steps in to break up the fight between the two men, his best friend is accidentally killed. Romeo runs after Tybalt in anger and kills him. Romeo is sent away from Verona but Friar Lawrence, the priest who organised the secret wedding between Romeo and Juliet, arranges for them to spend one night together as husband and wife. Meanwhile, the Capulets decide that Juliet must marry Count Paris immediately. When Juliet says that she doesn't want to, her parents are very angry with her, and her mother says she will never speak to her again. Of course, they do not know that she has already secretly married Romeo. Juliet asks Friar Lawrence to get her out of this difficult situation, so that she can see her beloved Romeo again. Friar Lawrence has an idea - he gives Juliet a drug which will make everyone think that she is dead, when in fact she's only in a long, deep sleep. While Juliet is sleeping, Friar Lawrence sends a message to Romeo to tell him to come to her tomb and take her away. When the guests arrive for Juliet's wedding the next day, Juliet's lifeless body is discovered. Believing she is dead, her family put her in their tomb. Tragically, Romeo never gets Friar Lawrence's message that Juliet has taken a drug and is really alive, he only hears that she is dead. Romeo returns to Verona, and goes to Juliet's tomb. There, inside the tomb, he meets Count Paris, who has also come to say goodbye to Juliet. The two fight and Romeo kills him. Romeo still believes that Juliet is dead, so he drinks poison and dies, but soon after this, Juliet's drug stops working and she wakes up. She sees that Romeo is dead, takes his knife, and kills herself too. When the Capulets and Montagues discover both their children dead, they are united in their sadness. The two families decide to make peace with each other, and promise to build a monument to the memory of both Romeo and Juliet.\n",
            "You are late! I'm sorry, Ashlie. I've got great news. I've been offered a real acting job. Well, that's fantastic. What's the job? I'm going to be playing Shakespeare. His plays are amazing. Oh Stephen, I'm so pleased, that is great news. I know. I've got to go and collect my costume from the Globe Theatre now. It's just round the corner. The Globe! That is where Shakespeare's plays were performed in London. I have always wanted to go to the Globe. I'll come with you. This is my big chance. Every actor wants to be in a Shakespeare play. I can't believe you got a proper job as an actor. Can't believe it? Really? No, honestly. It's great. I'm really impressed. Well, I think theatre people can recognise real talent when they see it. Real talent, eh? It's all about characters. Shakespeare created great characters. Kings, princes, heroes like Hamlet. I'd make a great Hamlet. To be or not to be. That is the question. To be or not to be - late. Come on Stephen, get a move on! Wow - this is amazing! I know. Can you imagine life here in Shakespeare's time? Yes - no mobile phones, no computers, no Facebook. How would we survive? Hello. Welcome to the Globe Theatre. This is where the tour begins. Great. So the original Globe was built not far from here in the late 1500s. Shakespeare was one of the owners of the theatre and his plays were performed there for many years. So what happened to the first Globe? The first Globe Theatre actually burnt down in 1613. It was during a performance of Henry VIII and a stage cannon accidentally set fire to the roof. OK, it's this way to the costume exhibition. You can really get a sense of what history was like in a place like this. The whole world's a stage and all men and women are mere players. Come on, Stephen, you're not on stage now. We're going. Is this really what the actors would have worn? Yes, these are copies of traditional costumes as they would have been in Shakespeare's day. Can I ask a question? Did they have women in the acting troupe or was it just men? No, men and boys acted out all of the female roles so these costumes would all have been worn by men. OK, so moving on... What's wrong? I'm not really into history. I'm going to pick up my costume and I'll see you later. OK. See you in a bit. So, Ash, what do you think of this? It's fantastic. I love the hat. I know, it's a pretty amazing costume. I must be playing a prince or a king or someone really important. That's great, Stephen. Maybe you have the lead role? That's it - you're right. The director must have seen my star qualities. Star qualities, eh? Yeah. I was born to be a star. I've got so much talent!\n",
            "Wow, Stephen. Here we are, the RSC, the Royal Shakespeare Company. It's such a famous theatre. All the greatest actors have played Shakespeare here. I'm getting a bit nervous now. You'll be fine, you're so lucky - it is an amazing place to perform. I am getting a bit jealous now! Can I have your autograph? Stop it. I'd better go in and find the director. Are you going to be okay on your own? Don't be silly, I'll be fine. I'll just go and do the tourist thing around Stratford. I think I'll visit the house where Shakespeare was born. Okay, I'll call you later and tell you when the play starts. Ah, I can't wait to see you on stage. Good luck! Thanks, bye. Bye. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the East and Juliet is the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon. Me? See how she leans her cheek upon her hand: O that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that cheek! Oh, alright then. Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love. And I'll no longer be a Capulet. Shall I hear more? Shall I speak at this? Thanks, that was really good fun. You were really good. You're a great actress. Thank you, I really enjoyed it. So do you always play Romeo and Juliet here? No, it varies, we might do Macbeth next. I think I'd better go then before you ask me to be one of the witches. I have to go and meet my brother soon anyway. He's performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Lucky him. But you're welcome here any time. Sorry. Hi, Stephen, you'll never guess. I actually got to do some Shakespeare too... I was Juliet. It was fantastic... So how's it going? Well, do you want me to come over? Well, okay What's up? It's Stephen, I don't think he wants me to go over and watch him, but - it must just be first night nerves. I think I'm going to go anyway and surprise him. OK. Bye! Thanks again, then. Bye. Excuse me. Do you know when the show starts? Hi, Ash. Stephen, you really are playing Shakespeare, then! Come on.\n",
            "Prospero was the ruler of Milan in Italy but he was betrayed by his brother Antonio. Antonio took control of the city, and ordered his soldiers to kill Prospero and his family. Prospero managed to escape in a small boat with his books about magic and his young daughter Miranda. Together they sailed away to an island, where they lived for the next 12 years, along with a strange half-human called Caliban, who Prospero has made his slave. During this time, Prospero's brother, Antonio, has ruled Milan. One day, he goes to a wedding in Tunisia. On the way back from the wedding, his ship passes close to the island where Prospero and Miranda are living. Prospero uses his magic to cause a violent storm with thunder and lightning. Antonio and all the other people on the ship are frightened, and think they are going to sink. The ship's passengers all survive the storm and land safely on the island, but they are in separate groups, so they don't know if the others have survived too. One of the survivors of the shipwreck is a young man called Ferdinand, who was travelling on the ship with his father. Ferdinand and his father have both survived, but do not know that the other is alive. On the island Ferdinand goes exploring, and meets Miranda. Miranda has never seen a young man before, and she and Ferdinand fall in love at first sight. Prospero does not want things to develop too quickly between his daughter and this man, so he uses his magic to make Ferdinand work for him. Soon, Prospero frees Ferdinand from his work and agrees that Miranda and Ferdinand can get married. He prepares some magic for them, and the happy couple sit down to watch the performance. Prospero's slave, Caliban, also meets two other survivors of the shipwreck. They get drunk together, and he persuades the other two to kill Prospero. The three drunk men arrive at Prospero's hut, all ready to kill him. But Prospero distracts them by leaving rich colourful clothes there. When the three drunks see the clothing, they decide to steal it instead of killing Prospero. They are then attacked by a group of dogs and run away. When Antonio, Prospero's brother, arrives at the hut, Prospero tells everyone his life story and what Antonio did to him 12 years earlier in Milan. Prospero says that he now forgives Antonio for betraying him. Prospero also forgives the three drunks for planning to murder him. He then reunites Ferdinand and his father. Finally, some sailors arrive and announce that the ship is fine after all. It is safe and ready to sail to Italy. Prospero says that he does not want to be a magician any more. Instead, he will return to Italy and become the ruler of Milan once again.\n",
            "Hello, my name is Elena. I'm 14 years old and I'm from Ruse in Bulgaria. My question is, what are the benefits of social media? This question is important to me because a lot of people consider social media unhealthy. We see it all the time. There's loads of stories around about how bad social media is for us and how large parts of our lives are in the hands of a few massive companies. I'm Cybersecurity Reporter at the BBC, which means that a big part of my job is holding these big companies to account. I spend a lot of time looking at the negative sides of social media and I pretty much take the positives for granted. So getting this question is actually really good for me because it can remind me of all the good things that have come about since social media was invented. I grew up in a time before social media. Not quite that long ago! We still had mobile phones and the internet, but it wasn't quite like it is now. Everything was much slower and much more difficult. People still mainly communicated by phone call, which means that if you made plans, you had to stick to them. Or you could leave your mate waiting in the rain. And now we're more connected than ever. Most of us are spending time every day with our friends online and sharing our lives with people across the world. If you're feeling isolated or lonely or if you feel like there's something you need help with, you can find a community through social media who can share their experiences and help you out. All this communication can lead to a greater understanding of each other and also bring some real change. It's hard to imagine something like the climate strike movement spreading as far or as fast as it has, without social media. It helped amplify the voice of a 15-year-old activist in Sweden, so she's been heard around the world. And there are some pretty direct benefits too. Tools have been made that encourage people to make the world around them better, whether that's by giving money, telling your friends and family you're safe or by donating blood. In fact, this alone has led to more than 50 million people becoming blood donors around the world, literally life savers. So, there really are some great benefits to social media but it's still really new. These apps are emerging technologies and when things affect the way that we live and work and do things as much as social media has, it takes a long time to work out what the knock-on effects could be. It's probably up to the next generation to work through some of these problems and hopefully, if they do a good job, we'll be talking a lot more about the positive sides of social media in the future.\n",
            "Could these two high-profile journeys to the edge of space by wealthy businessmen Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson mean space travel is one step closer for the rest of us? Well, to go anytime soon, you would need a lot of money. One seat on board billionaire Jeff Bezos's rocket ship was auctioned for 28 million dollars. Whilst there was nowhere for passengers of these two flights to stop off, the first-ever space hotel is expected to open in 2027. The Voyager Station hotel will float in low orbit, and guests will be able to see the Earth as they move round the planet. But large rockets need lots of fuel to propel them, so space travel can have a hefty carbon footprint. Historically, rockets have been powered by kerosene, but some are now launched by using cleaner methods, such as green hydrogen.\n",
            "Scots teenager Fraser Doherty is well on his way to becoming a millionaire, and it's all thanks to his gran, and her jam. SuperJam started when I was about fourteen years old. And my grandmother just told me how to make jam one afternoon and I got really excited about it and started selling it to the neighbours, and at church fairs and farmers' markets. It soon got to the point where I was making about a thousand jars of jam a week, in my parents' tiny little kitchen. And, you know, they were never getting in to cook their dinner. And I soon moved into a factory and started, after a few years, supplying Tesco and Asda and Morrisons, and all the big supermarkets. So it's been quite an adventure and it's really taken off from tiny little beginnings here in this kitchen. He may have started small, but now over half a million jars of SuperJam are produced every year at this factory in the north of England. He supplies nearly 1000 supermarkets around Britain. Not bad for a nineteen-year-old who still lives at home. When I was fourteen I was cooking, you know, a few dozen jars at a time in my parents' kitchen. I would never have imagined that everything would have grown to the point where I'm supplying major supermarkets and, you know, people all over the world are interested in SuperJam. Fraser's original idea was to create the healthiest preserve possible, using grape juice to sweeten it rather than sugar. And the recipe is going down a treat. His gran and the rest of the family are delighted at his spreading success. Fraser's father: Even around the world there's quite a bit of interest, so hopefully he'll keep going and I can retire soon. He hopes 2009 will see him crack the lucrative American market. It would be a jammy break for this jam entrepreneur. Rona Dougall, Sky News, Edinburgh.\n",
            "What is Ramadan? You have to fast from dawn to sunset, and you feel like how the poor people feel and you have a strong connection with Allah, God, and you have to read the holy Quran. It's very hard. And you can't you have to survive as well, without food. I enjoy taking part in Ramadan, of course, because it's a really spiritual time. You feel very close to God. How else do people celebrate? My mum and dad can fast, and I can't. I raise money for lots of charities. You have to pay particular attention to your prayers, and so make sure you don't start fighting with people. What about school? I just won't fast during my exams because in Islam, children aren't allowed to fast. I am allowed to do a few, but just when I can. When I'm able to. For one whole day fasting I think you need to be 12 or 13. I've had a small fast. You start at dawn, at the same time as adults, but you end at a time round about midday. I've never done it and I'm going to have to do it my first time. What is Eid? Right at the end we have Eid. We have a celebration and we can talk and play with our family and friends.\n",
            "Britain is a nation of animal lovers. From the cute and cuddly to slimy and scary, we love them all. Some of us have a passion for our pets, the animals that become part of the family. But here at the Wildlife Rescue and Ambulance Service, they are wild about wildlife. London is home to millions of people but it's also home to many wild animals and sometimes they can get hurt. Here at the centre, the staff look after injured or very young animals and then hopefully get them well enough so they can go back into the wild. It's hard work looking after them. The first task of the day is serving breakfast. Most of the people who work here are volunteers. None of them are paid. They help out and provide their time for free, for the love of the animals. Hi, Barry. Hi, Joe. I'm here to help. Great. There's a spare broom here. Great. Thank you very much. So tell me about the rescue centre, Barry. Primarily our work here is to care for sick and injured animals and birds and where possible release them back into the wild where they belong. And you're a charity, aren't you? Yes, we are. Obviously we rely upon donations to keep the work going, by people coming and visiting us at the centre and seeing some of our animals and kind donations from the public. And with this many animals here there's obviously a lot of work to do. Yes, yes, it's not easy. There is always a lot to do. Well, let's get going. Good idea. Loss of natural habitat has led to wildlife and humans living in closer proximity to each other than ever before. When man meets animal, it's the wildlife that often comes off worse. Road traffic accidents, poisoning and attacks from domestic pets often cause injury. When the animals are first brought in, they often need treatment here at the animal hospital. Let's go and visit some of the patients. June takes care of the baby animals. Some of the tiny ones need a lot of attention. So what's wrong with this hedgehog, June? This hedgehog was attacked by a dog and it's got two wounds: one underneath, one on top. And what sort of treatments are you going to give him? Well, I'll give him a course of antibiotics. Hopefully that should make him better. And will he be released into the wild? Not this one, because this one's not going to be fit enough, so this one will stay with me until next year. Now it's a big moment as one of the little hedgehogs is going to be released back into the wild. When this little chap arrived he wasn't strong enough to feed but now he's well enough to survive in the wild. The big question is: will he want to leave? Well, he's not too sure at first. But now he's made it back to where he belongs - in the wild. And it's thanks to this and other rescue centres across Britain that more animals are free to be wild again.\n",
            "Our bodies are as much as 60% water. All living things contain it and, like us, depend upon it for survival. Although 70% of the Earth is covered with water, a staggering number of the world's poor lack even the most basic sanitation and access to clean water. 97% of the water on Earth is salt water. 2% is frozen in glaciers and ice caps. Only 1% is fresh water. That needs to be enough for everyone. All seven billion of us. One out of every eight people on Earth searches every day for clean water. One in six has no access to a toilet. None. Think about that. What would your life be like if that were you? 'Hmm, well, no bottled water, I guess. And no water running from the tap at home, so no shower. But seriously, no toilet? Not even this?' Every day, women around the world walk mile after mile to collect water for bathing, cooking, cleaning and for their families to drink. They can only take back home as much as they can carry. Often that water is teeming with bacteria that will make them sick. But they have little choice. To go without even this polluted water would mean dehydration and possible death. 'You can only go three days without water.' Countless hours spent searching or waiting in line. Lives and days wasted by illness. Time lost that could have been spent in school and work, planting, building, providing for their loved ones. Every twenty seconds a child dies from a water-related illness like diarrhoea.\n",
            "You really were serious, weren't you? Of course I was! Stephen and I are going to York in the north of England today. We're going to do some archaeology, but Stephen wants to take his metal detector. Well, I want to try out my new present. York is famous for its history. I want to find some real treasure! An old sword, an ancient coin... an old tin can! Yeah, right. It'll be the same as every year; you get a new toy and then you get bored of it after five minutes. Oh, stop moaning. It's a long drive to York. And whatever you do, don't forget your wellies. History hunting's dirty work. Oh, wow Stephen, look. Look at this shop. They sell real pieces of history in here. Come on, let's go in and have a look. Excuse me. Are these real? They are. Those are Roman. Wow, where do they come from? Generally the UK, but also in Europe as well. Oh, this looks unusual. Is it very valuable? That one, that's about 75 pounds. That's a Roman military cloak brooch. It would have been used to fasten a cloak or a toga. Lots of things were lost in those days. Well, well I wouldn't want to lose something like this. I'm sure whoever lost that was very upset. I bet. Wow, Stephen, come and look at this. This is so lovely. I would love to wear a piece of history. How much is it? That one's 120 pounds. I'll take it! No, Stephen. That's too expensive. No, it isn't. It's a present, Ashlie. For who? For you, of course! Oh, Stephen. That is so lovely of you. Thank you! Right, what now? More shopping maybe? Well, I thought we could have a look around the Viking museum. A museum? Can't we do that tomorrow? You are going to love this museum. Whatever. This is amazing. Wow, look at that! Imagine walking these streets in Viking times. The sights, the sounds. The smells! It really stinks in here. Ashlie, it's all part of the experience. This is what a real Viking town would have looked like and smelt like. Well, it smells pretty bad. Come on, Ash. Let's do some authentic Viking shopping. Wow, what a beautiful city! Oh, you can have a look at the architecture later. Over there's the Viking excavation. We need to sign up for tomorrow and I can't wait to use my metal detector. Stephen, I'm not even sure they're going to let you use that thing. Excuse me. Can you tell me where to go for tomorrow's dig, please? Yes, the dig is right over there and you'll need to be here for seven o'clock tomorrow to pick up your tools. What? Seven o'clock?Man: I'm afraid so. Well, I've got my metal detector. So I guess all I need is a spade to dig up the treasure. You won't be needing that! This is what we use. Come on, Stephen. Thanks. See you tomorrow!\n",
            "Oh, come on, Ash! We're going to be late. Stephen, I'm too tired and it's too early. I need a coffee and I need a shower. Come on! We're in York and we're supposed to be taking in some history, but Ashlie seems to want to stay in bed. We can stop to get breakfast on the way. But I need a shower. I'll meet you there later? OK. Well, you can join in this afternoon's session. It starts at 12. Ashlie: OK. I'm off. I don't want to be late. OK, I'll see you there later. Hi. Excuse me. I'm here for the dig.Man: Hi. Have you done this before? No, it's my first time. Okay. Well, if you want to grab a trowel, I'll show you what you have to do. Okay. What we have here is an early medieval refuse pit and it's full of things like pottery and animal bone. The way we dig it is just to take a trowel and scrape away layer by layer. Bit slow isn't it? It is a little bit slow but there are a lot of small finds, so you have to be very careful in case you miss anything. Do you ever find anything? You know, like treasure? We do. It's rare. It's not every day but when we do, you always get a big cheer from the archaeologists. I'd better get started, then. Absolutely. So you finally made it! So what did I miss? What have you found so far? Oh well, I'm making good progress and I'm starting to really enjoy it. You know you've got to take it slowly - you can't just rush in and dig things out of the ground. Yeah alright, Stephen. So are these your finds? Is this your treasure? Oy! Stop complaining and start digging. Let's see what you can find. Blimey, this is hard work. And messy too. I am covered in mud... Oh, no! What? Stephen, my ring! I've lost my ring! It must have fallen off. Oh, I'm sure we can find it. Hurray!\n",

Oh, Brian, come on - you failed to meet agreed targets for the entire last quarter. We talked about this in your last performance review and I told you then it had to improve, and to be quite honest - it hasn't. Losing the DollarMart contract is the last straw.

Can you put me through to Marcia in HR, please? Thank you. Hi, Marcia. It's Philip here. Listen, I've had to let Brian go. He lost us the DollarMart account. Yeah, but it had been going on for a while, and he just wasn't pulling his weight any more. He'd been warned. His last performance review was really bad. He knew it was coming. So, we'll be looking for someone new and we'll need to decide on who that is. Who are we looking for? Good question. I was hoping you might be able to help me with that! Here's what I'm thinking and let me know if you agree. Well, obviously, they'll need to have a first degree. Doesn't matter what subject. And then a master's or an MBA, I'd say. Experience? At least five years' relevant experience in an international company. I want somebody with a proven track record. Oh, they have to be a team player - Brian never was - so strong interpersonal skills. Oh, and I want someone with vision... yes, 'vision'! Well, I know it's difficult to define. What I mean is, someone who knows we're in a rapidly changing market, and they can use it to our advantage. Experience with online sales, perhaps but... yes, I'd be interested in that. Oh, language skills. I can't emphasise that enough. Not necessarily a native speaker, but they must be very good at English. And another language as well - Spanish, or Mandarin is best. Does that sound OK to you? Great. OK, can you get an ad out on the website as soon as possible? Oh, and the trade press as well. OK, great. Thanks, Marcia. I want a new sales director by the end of the month. Bye!\n",
            "So, how many applications did we get, Marcia? Well, overall we've got over 200! That many? Yes, but most of which we can discard right away... people who don't have the right experience, qualifications, that kind of thing. Of course.  ... and then we get the people who submit ten-page-long CVs, or CVs in comic book font, or green ink, or... they attach a photo of themselves disco dancing, you know the kind of thing? So, I've whittled down the serious candidates to a shortlist of 12 people. And we'll interview all of them? I think we should but, obviously, I'll let you have a look first. Great. So, who have we got then? Well, I think we've got some pretty strong candidates. Two in particular. They have the right kind of profile? I'd certainly say so. Strong educational background, experience in multinational sales, language skills... Good. I look forward to meeting them. So, I'd say we do the standard interview format. Sure. A few general questions, then on to specifics. Yes, exactly. I want to hear specific details of when they've solved problems. Yes, and then something about 'vision', as you put it. Yes... what do you think about a brief presentation? I think that's a good idea. We could ask them to give a short presentation on where they see the company going and how they see themselves taking us there. Great! You know something? I'm really looking forward to this!\n",
            "Hi, I'm Marcia Boardman. I'm calling from WebWare. Oh, hi, Marcia. Great to hear from you. You'll have already been told you've been shortlisted for interview... Oh, yes, great... hello? Can you hear me? Yes... Is it OK if I call you now? Would you like me to call you back later? Erm, no, no, no, that's OK. Good. Well, we're very excited about meeting you. OK, I just want to talk you through the procedure for the day. Someone will meet you when you arrive, reimburse you for any travel expenses you may have, and then bring you up to meet myself and Philip Hart, the CEO. OK, sounds good. So, will you be the only members of the interview panel there, then? Yes, it'll be just me and Philip who will talk to you. The interview will be in three parts. First of all we'll ask you some general questions about yourself and your educational and professional background, then we'll move on to specifics. Oh, er, specifics? Erm, well, er, what kind of questions will you be asking? Well, it'll be very similar to the personal statement you submitted with your CV. We'll be expecting you to give actual examples of problems you've faced and solved, and of what you feel are your major successes in your career so far. OK, well, yeah, that sounds great. Can't wait! Then there'll be a chance for you to ask us any questions about the job itself or WebWare in general. Oh, erm, OK. I'll think of something! After that, we'd like you to give a short presentation on how you see WebWare as a company progressing, and how you see yourself taking us there. OK, so will I be expected to give, like, a formal-style presentation? It can be as formal or as informal as you like. There'll be a flip chart and a data projector there available. If you need anything else, just let us know. Oh, erm, OK, a presentation! Erm, I'll think of something. I haven't done one of those in a while... Is that all clear? Great. So, Daniel, I'll see you at 11 a.m., a week tomorrow. OK, great, yeah, I look forward to meeting you! Thanks, bye. OK, so, Sarah, we'll be seeing you at 1 p.m., a week tomorrow. Best of luck! Oh, thanks. I'll need it!\n",
            "Hi there! Good morning, Daniel! Oh, Dan, please. I'm Marcia Boardman - we spoke on the phone - and this is Philip Hart, our CEO. Hello! Nice to meet you both. So, it says here on your CV that you're interested in rock climbing. Yeah, I love it! Great, so do I! When did you last go climbing? Er, well, it was a while ago, now. Anywhere interesting? Yeah, I walked up the hill behind my house. Took me about 30 minutes! Oh. OK, erm, Daniel, can you tell us a little bit about your current position? Certainly. As it says in the CV, I'm part of the European sales team at Networld. We're the world's leading supplier of IT hardware. Why do you want to move on? Well, they're too small for me! Networld are too small for you? Yeah, I'm looking for something much bigger. Well, we're not a big company by any means, but we are looking to grow! Er, what first attracted you to WebWare in particular? Well, I see WebWare as kind of like a stepping stone... Sorry? Yeah, start here, gain the necessary experience, then move on to something bigger. OK... well, I do admire your ambition! Thanks. I've got lots of it! Let's move on to managing people. Can you give an example of a time when you had to deal with a particularly difficult managee? Sure, well, I think that's one of my strong points, actually. Er, a couple of years ago, I was working with a guy, he wasn't pulling his weight, basically being lazy - so I told him to get out. Oh, you didn't give him a performance review or a warning or perhaps try to develop his motivation? No, no, no, no. None of that rubbish. If someone's not working hard enough, then they're out! That's the way I work. I'm a hard man. I see. Erm, how would you handle a rapidly changing market? Basically not change anything at all! Just continue on as normal, regardless. Erm, according to your CV you are fluent in Mandarin... Well, I wouldn't say 'fluent', exactly, but I like Chinese food a lot so I can read the menu. So you can't actually speak the language? Er, no. Can you tell us about a time you had to close a particularly challenging deal? I haven't had one. They're all easy for me. I close deals all the time. OK, well, do you have any questions for us? No. Oh. OK. Erm, thanks. Let's move on to the presentation...\n",
            "Hi, Sarah. I'm Marcia Boardman. We spoke on the phone... Oh yes, I remember. I was having a bad day!  ... and, erm, this is Philip Hart, our CEO. Hello! Hello, it's very nice to meet you both. It says on your CV that you do voluntary work. Well, when I have time, yes! I do work at a centre for children with difficulties. That must be very interesting. It's rewarding and challenging. Sarah, can you tell us a little bit about your current position? I'm assistant sales director for a chain of language schools. So this post would be quite a change then. I don't think so, honestly, because the skills are the same, despite the product. Why are you thinking of moving on? Well, I've come as far as I can in my current position, I feel, and I'm 28 now and would love to take on some more responsibility. OK, um, let's move on to managing people. Can you give us an example of when you had to deal with a particularly difficult managee? Well, yes, I had two people working for me who didn't get along at all. They had no shared values, different temperaments and used to argue a lot. It looked like it was impossible for them to work together. So, I sat down with them and we talked about their differences and their problems, and after that things went much more smoothly. How would you deal with a rapidly changing and uncertain global market? Oh, that's actually something I wanted to talk about in my presentation, but I'd say to stay flexible and to diversify markets and sales strategies. It says on your CV you speak French and Spanish. Yes, I do. I lived in both France and Spain for a while. Any plans to learn other languages? I'd love to try! Erm, OK. Can you tell us about a time you had to close a particularly challenging deal? Well, the biggest contract I won - and the thing I'm most proud of professionally - was with a large university in India, to provide language training. The contract was full of technicalities and the client was very picky! But I still pulled it off. OK, erm, do you have any questions for us? Yes, about your ethical policy and your carbon footprint. I was wondering whether you are planning to reduce your carbon footprint and whether all your products are ethically sourced. That's a very good question and that's something we're moving towards at the moment. OK, well, let's move on to the presentation.\n",
            "When I was asked to do a presentation on 'Where WebWare is going and what I can do to help it get there', my first thought was simple: me! As you've already seen, I've got a lot of skills and the right kind of personality needed to do a job like this. Here's a slide I made! You see that? That's my sales team. They love me! Certainly going to be sad to see me leave. Outside-the-box thinking - that's what I've got! OK. To start with, I did a careful SWOT analysis using the data I had available, which is obviously only partial. I looked at aspects such as competitors, online visibility, changing technologies and R&D. On the basis of this, I believe WebWare should carry out some careful market research, strengthen its brand awareness in secondary markets and improve the flexibility of its offer. If this produces positive results, I think it should be possible to maintain the premium pricing policy. Here's the sales figures for the last job I did - all down to me. Blue-sky thinking! Finally, to finish my presentation, I'd like to play you a song I wrote... OK, OK... that's enough. Thanks, Daniel. Great! So, does that mean I've got the job? Erm, we'll be in touch over the next five days to let you know. OK, great. Thank you. This is how I predict a sales pattern would go. I have to emphasise these are only speculative results at the moment. The key words are caution, adaptability and consolidation of main product lines - WebWare's 'cash cows', if you like. It's important to be flexible, yet reliable. Oh, and another thing is you need to improve the delivery times on your online orders. I hope all that's clear. Do you have any questions? No, thank you, Sarah. That's all very clear. You've given us quite a lot to think about, there! Yeah, thanks a lot, Sarah. We'll be in touch over the next few days to let you know about the appointment. Thank you both for your time. It's been a pleasure meeting both of you. Bye bye! Bye. Bye. Bye.\n",
            "So, what did you think? Well, between Sarah Timms and Daniel Watson, I think the choice is pretty obvious! Yes, so do I. Watson looked so good on paper... But he seemed very good when I first spoke to him too. First impressions often lie! Indeed. I think a lot of his CV was - how shall we say? Counterfactual. Yes. It just wasn't true. You should never lie on your CV! He had very good references, though. Very strange. I guess some people just like that sort of style, but he wouldn't fit in with us. I mean, it's important to be confident but he was overconfident. I couldn't agree more. His body language was all wrong. He came across as arrogant. Then he gave very vague answers - no specific details of what exactly he'd done in his job. Whereas Sarah Timms...  ... knew exactly what she was talking about. Yes, she was very convincing, self-assured, but not arrogant. She'd clearly done some research on the company and knew what she was talking about. Oh, I thought her presentation was excellent. Yes, it was. But I am a little worried about how much experience she has. Yes, true, but she seems very ready to take on the challenges the role would offer her. So, who do we give the job to? Sarah! Yes, I agree entirely! Great! I'll phone her straight away offering the post and I'll write a rejection to Mr Watson. OK.\n",
            "OK, OK, that's great! We'll be pleased to have you on the team. Looking forward to seeing you next week. Bye! Was that Sarah? Yes. She's going to accept the job and wants to come in next week for a chat. Oh, great news! Now you just have to tell the other guy that we don't want him. Mm, I hate giving bad news. I'm glad that it's your job and not mine! OK, may as well do it straight away. 'Dear Mr Watson, we regret to inform you you have not got the job.' Hmm, sounds a bit too direct. How about: 'Dear Mr Watson, thank you for your application to WebWare. We regret to inform you you weren't successful'? Erm, I think you should say something positive. But he was terrible! Well, he wasn't great, no, but I think we should be positive and polite. Yes, you're absolutely right. OK, how about this: 'Dear Mr Watson, thank you for your application to WebWare. You were a promising candidate. However, we regret to inform you that the competition for the post was very strong and we will not be offering you the position. Yours sincerely, etc. etc.' Yes, that's more like it. But we should include some feedback. Of course. How about if I add this? 'In future, you may wish to moderate your personal style and carefully fact-check your CV.' How does that sound? Erm, I'm not sure what 'moderate your personal style' means. It's a bit vague. Hmm, OK. How about 'give more specific examples of your achievements and show how you work as part of a team'? OK, yes, I like that. And remember to finish with something like, 'We wish you the best of luck in the future.' Of course. I certainly do wish him luck! OK, done. I'll send it now.\n",
            "Hi! Welcome to WebWare. Thanks. Nice to see you again. You too. Erm, so you said you wanted to come in and have a chat before you started. Yeah, I just wanted to have a look around and ask a few more questions, if I can. Sure, fire away! Well, I was delighted to receive the job offer. Good. We were delighted to offer it to you. But before I sign the contract there were one or two specifics I wanted to talk about. OK, 'specifics'? Well, there's a pay scale, instead of a fixed salary? Yes, as a new employee you'd be at the lower end of the pay scale. But taking my experience into account... Well, you haven't had that much experience. We see you as an investment... But that salary would only be a little more than I'm making now. So, instead of asking for a higher level on the pay scale, I thought this could be compensated by adding certain bonuses. For instance, if I make certain sales targets, or even break them, I would be looking for a good cash payment or stock options in the company. Well, that is something we sometimes offer senior members of staff, but to show good faith I'll provisionally offer you the bonus scheme, but I'll have to OK it with Philip first. That's fine. I also see that there are 25 days' holiday. Yes. That's standard. It's not very much for a high-pressure job, though. I can't offer you any more holiday. No, but I was wondering if we could delay my start date, so instead of starting a week from now, as we discussed, I could start in a month's time? You're a tough negotiator, Sarah! That's one of the reasons you hired me! Yes, of course. OK, I think we can do that. I'll look forward to seeing you in a month and earning those bonuses!\n",
            "Sarah, good to meet you again! Welcome on board. Thanks, Philip. I'm very pleased to be here. I hope you enjoyed your holiday. Where did you go? I went to Thailand. It was lovely - great beaches and lovely food. Oh, lucky you! It's time for hard work now, though! I'm ready for it! Let me show you to your office. Didn't know I have my own office! So, you don't hot-desk here? Well, most people do, as you can see, but we thought you'd need all your own private space. Yes, especially if you're meeting clients directly. But the atmosphere is actually quite informal because it's open-plan. Oh, that's good. I like that. You definitely get the sense of everyone being really busy! Yes, they are, I hope! So, this is your space! Wow! Great, lots of space! My last office was much smaller. How many people did you work with there? I had a team of three. Well, here you'll have six people under you. We'll introduce you to your sales team after lunch. Hmm, that sounds good. What do you usually do for lunch? Oh, well, some people bring it in, but there's a canteen on the ground floor. Food's actually quite good and pretty cheap! Great. Now then, I'll tell you about your schedule. There's a sales and marketing meeting every Monday, as well as a meet-up with various heads of department on Thursday afternoons, just so we know what we're doing. Other than that, how you organise your time is up to you. That's fine. I'm a good time manager! We'll leave you to it, then! I think I'm going to like working here!\n",
            "My name is Yusra. I used to be just like you. I had many friends, I went to school and I loved to go to the pool in my hometown in Syria. My coach said if I worked hard enough, I could make it into the Olympics one day. Then the war came and everything changed. I couldn't swim or meet with my friends as often as I wanted. My life was in danger. I had to escape Syria. My parents finally agreed that my big sister Sara and I could travel to Turkey. It was hard to leave my family behind but I had no choice. If we made it to Europe, my parents and little sister would follow. We needed peace. In Turkey we boarded a boat to Greece. Then disaster happened. My sister and I jumped into the water, trying to pull the boat to shore. For more than three and a half hours we gave everything we had. We couldn't give up. Most of the people in the boat couldn't swim. They needed us. We all made it to Europe alive! Suddenly I was a refugee. I had to rely on the kindness of others. Borders were closing across Europe. We didn't know where to go or what to do. We finally arrived in our new home, Germany. I was safe. I wanted everything to be normal again. I wanted to swim. So I started practising again. My coach helped me achieve my dream to swim at the Olympics. I may not have won a gold medal, but I won something far more important. My dignity. My name is Yusra. I am a refugee who found the strength to rebuild my life with support from my new community. I am proud to stand for respect, safety and dignity for all people fleeing violence. Together we can help others.\n",
            "Every moment of our lives we experience a force that we can't see or touch, yet this force is able to keep us firmly rooted to the ground. It is, of course, gravity. But despite its intangible nature, we always know it's with us. Now if I was to ask you 'how do you know that there's gravity around here?' then you might say 'well, it's obvious. You know, I can just do an experiment. I can drop something'. Well, yes, but actually, gravity is a little bit more subtle than that, but to really experience it, to understand it, you have to do something pretty extreme. And this plane has been modified to help me do it. Thanks to its flight plan, it's known as the 'Vomit Comet'. Once we've climbed to fifteen thousand metres, this plane does something no ordinary flight would do. Its engines are throttled back and the jet falls to Earth. And then, something quite amazing happens. I'm now plummeting towards the ground, just like someone's cut the cable in a lift. And you see that I'm not moving relative to Einstein. We're all just floating! By simply falling at the same rate as the plane, for a few fleeting moments we're all free of gravity's grip. But this isn't just a joyride. Now look, there's something very profound here because, although I'm falling towards the ground, as you see gravity has completely gone away. Gravity's not here anymore. I've cancelled gravity out just by falling - and if you understand that, then you will understand gravity! So it is possible, by the simple act of falling, to get a very different experience of gravity.\n",
            "This may look like Paris, but we're in Blackpool, in the North of England - about an hour's drive from Manchester. And as you can see, it's a seaside town and for more than a hundred years people have been coming here for their holidays. In fact, Ashlie and I used to come here when we were kids. Yes, that's right. I used to love coming to Blackpool - the beach, the sunshine, the fish and chips. And the ice cream And I love the theme park and all the rides. Come on Ash, this is going to be great! Excuse me. Have you just been on this? Yeah mate! What was it like? It were crazy! I've been on it about four times - I can't get enough! Was it scary? It was scary - I think it was. But you enjoyed it? Yeah - I loved it. Alright - thanks guys - see you later! Come on Ash, shall we have a go? No way! Oh Ash, don't be such a chicken. No way, Stephen. You can have a go on that if you want, but there is no way I'm going on it. I'll wave to you when I go past. See you later! See you! Hiya! Blimey, are you OK? You look a little white, Stephen. What? I've never felt better. That was amazing, Ashlie. You should have come on it, too. Shame you were too scared. You weren't scared? Of course not. I loved it. Oh, that's great - funny though. If you weren't scared, well then - who's this is in the photographs? Um... I mean it looks like you, doesn't it? Look, he's even wearing the same t-shirt. Oh, come on Ash, let's have a look at the other rides. Oh, I like the look of this one, the log flume. Shall we have a go on that? You can if you want, but... to be honest, it doesn't look like my kind of ride. I like the exciting ones, you know? I'll watch you. Are you sure you'll be OK? You're not scared of getting wet? Don't worry - I'll be fine. Stephen, look at you. What happened? Don't ask! Why aren't you wet? You know what? I think I've had enough of the theme park. I need to sit down. I'll tell you what - why don't we go and have a nice cup of tea, eh? And some fish and chips? Yeah, let's do that. Come on then. Hang on, Ash. We'll have that cup of tea in a minute, but first I have got to have a go on that.\n",
            "Ah, it's great to be back here. Do you remember when we used to come here when we were kids? Yeah, I remember. And I remember that you used to spend all your pocket money on rubbish - he used to buy junk like this! Come on - let's get a photo! Hey - it says here that Blackpool is the ballroom dancing capital of the world? Really? It says that people come from all around the world to dance in the Tower Ballroom. Come on. Let's have a look. Yeah, let's have a go! Oh, hello there, Shemaine. So why do you think people enjoy ballroom dancing so much? I think it's such a sociable thing to do together. It keeps you fit, it keeps you young. So what kind of people would you get coming to ballroom dancing, then? It varies. They start from young children - right through to the older people. So why do you think that Blackpool is the ballroom dancing capital of the world? Looking at this venue, it's such a beautiful place. There's nowhere like it. The floor is fantastic to dance on. And do you get visitors coming from all over the world? Yes we do; from Italy, Russia, America... Well we love dancing, my brother and I. I think we should start with the waltz. That was great. I'm starving. Excuse me. Could you recommend a restaurant? Where's a good place to eat round here? But Stephen, you promised me fish and chips. We can't come to Blackpool and not have fish and chips! That's right Ash. I did, didn't I? OK - where can I get a great fish and chips? That's easy. You go down there. You turn right, across from the Pleasure Beach Hotel. Yes, that's the best in town. Ah fantastic. I'm feeling really hungry now - I need to eat! Me, too. Thank you, girls. Oh, I don't believe it - the shop's closed. That is so unfair. Well, what are we going to do now? Listen, Ash. I really want fish as well. I'm really sorry about that, but I've got a good idea.\n",
            "The British pub is said to be “the heart of England”. There are around fifty thousand public houses, or pubs, in the UK. This is the Crown, a pub in the village of Charlton on Otmore in Oxfordshire. Pub names like “The Crown” and “The Prince of Wales” are very popular and celebrate the royal family. The pub is a place to meet friends. But they are very different from a café as pubs serve alcohol. At one point everyone drank beer. The water wasn't very good so it was safer to drink beer than water. People often called this “small beer”. Can I get you anything? No small, or large beer for me thanks. In the past, the local pub was the centre of the community. Gossip and business deals happened right here in the pub. The Crown is more than a hundred years old. The landlord, Mark Franklin, grew up in the village. Can I give you a hand with the polishing? Yes you can. So Mark tell me how important is the pub for the community? The pub is very important to the community because it's the main meeting point for the village. So who comes here? People come here from all walks of life, old and young. They meet here for darts nights and quiz nights. Great, so how has the pub changed over the years? The pub has changed in the way we do food here now and we show satellite TV. Well many pubs like this in rural areas have closed. Do you think the Crown will stay open? I hope the pub will stay open because I feel it's the heart of the village. Would you like a drink? Oh yes please. This is thirsty work. But there's is a big difference between the rural village pub and pubs in towns and cities. There are many different types of pubs. There are traditional pubs, famous for games like darts. And gastro pubs. These are pubs that serve expensive food. There are also pubs that are owned by large companies. These pubs, wherever you are in the UK, all look very similar. And then there are bars that look a bit like pubs. Like this one. They seem to be having a good time. But drinking too much has become a problem in the UK. When people drink a lot and get very drunk very quickly, this is called binge drinking. Binge drinking is increasing in young people. There are several organisations that try to help young people with their drink problems. Glenda Lee works for Turning Point. So Glenda, tell me, do you see many young people with alcohol problems? We do, Carmen, we see more young people coming to us for help. So what kind of problems does drinking too much alcohol create? Drinking too much alcohol can lead to violence, accidents, to unprotected sex, to addiction and the possibility of death. Is it getting worse? Yes, the problem is getting worse. We've seen an increase in the past four years of young people and young adult drinking and especially binge drinking. So what are you doing about it? One thing that Turning Point is doing about it is a product called a binge pack. Inside is information about drinking, about how much is too much. We have a condom to encourage safe sex - and that's a binge pack. Going to the pub is an important part of British culture. And drinking too much has become a problem. But going to the pub doesn't mean you have to drink alcohol I'm going to have a nice cup of tea!\n",
            "Camden Market is made up of many different markets. The first market was called Camden Lock because it was next to the canal. It first opened in 1972 and is now one of the largest markets in the UK. Half a million people visit Camden market each week. And with hundreds of stalls, there's something for everyone. But Camden is best known for fashion and famous for punk. Everyone knows what punk fashion is but 30 years ago it didn't even exist. Clothes like this seem quite normal now. In the 1970s it shocked many people because it had never been seen before. Punks were young people who were anti-government, anti-popular music and anti-fashion. Punk music was loud, wild and about breaking all the rules. Punk style was the same. Punks created their own cheap fashion with torn clothes, safety pins and spiky hair. Punk fashion is still here today and it's still about rejecting ordinary fashion and standing out, but there are lots of ways of looking different. Camden isn't the only place for fashion. London Fashion Week, held twice a year, is a great place to see clothes by British designers and the latest new fashion trends. British fashion is very important; creatively, it's very important all around the world. Lots of the kind of fashion trends that you and I end up wearing started out on the catwalks in London. British fashion is different from the fashion that comes from different countries around the world. Often the shape of the clothes is a bit more aggressive - maybe a bit sharper and we try to come up with looks that are a bit more imaginative so possibly they're less wearable, less classic clothing, but always very exciting. Back in Camden there are still many other fashion trends. People mix different ideas and create new looks. Another style that really stands out is Cyber-Goth. So this is one of Europe's biggest Cyber-Goth shops. What's a Cyber-Goth? Take a look at these. So Jack, what exactly is a Cyber-Goth? A Cyber-Goth is someone that doesn't think about what other people think about them. And it's someone with a very strong fashion sense. It's kind of a mixture of varied stuff; like punk, Goth and American surfing scene. So, talk me through the influences of your look, the hair? Well, my hair is a really, really lovely creation I think. It takes everything from the punk style like colourful stuff - really standing out. The t-shirt? My t-shirt is a Cyber-Goth futuristic style. It's an exo-tubes top - which means like, it shows the inside of my body. The trousers? I really like the American surfing scene - I'm really into that. So I wanted something to remind me of that so I chose these really, really baggy trousers. And finally the belt? Twenty-first century. So punk maybe thirty years old but here in Camden it's constantly evolving in the twenty first century.\n",
            "Here we are in Camden Lock Market. It's a great place to go shopping and we need to buy a birthday present for our Mum. What do you think we should get her, Ash? Well our Mum loves nice clothes and costume jewellery. So - I'm sure we'll find something here. It's huge here, Ash. I'll tell you what, let's split up, see what we can find and I'll meet you back here in one hour. OK, I'll see you back here in an hour, then. Oh, Ash - can you lend me 50 quid? 50 quid, eh? Don't worry, you'll get it back! That should do it. Thank you. OK, I'll see you back here later. See you! Wow, look at these! I've never seen one of these before. How much are these? Five pound each. Excuse me. Do you have this in another colour? Hiya - how's it going? Hi, very well. How are you? Good, thanks. I like these, how much are they? Er, the leaf lights - they are £21.95. Hmm, I'm not sure she'll like them. Can you help me? I'm looking for a birthday present for my mum. Any ideas? What type of thing does she like? Well, she's quite stylish - modern, I suppose. Well, the yin yang's really modern. What do you think of that? Hmm. What about that one over there? Ah, the ball lights - lovely - it's fifty pounds. Oh. How about... forty, seeing as it's your mother's birthday? Twenty? Twenty? That's really cheap. How about I meet you halfway - twenty-five? Great, thanks mate. My Mum's going to love this. You're welcome. Aah - I'm running out of time Excuse me, how much is this? Er, that's fifty pounds. So? How did you get on? Pretty good, I guess. I bought this fantastic candle holder. It was a little bit expensive, but I think Mum will love it. In fact I almost bought one for myself! Yeah great - and look what I found! Well, that is just crazy - how did we end up buying the same candle holder in this huge market??! I'll tell you what we'll do. You take this one. You said you almost bought one for yourself - and you lent me fifty pounds, right? Right. So you take this one, I'll get lunch and we'll call it quits! Come on - it's time to get something to eat. Lunch is on me, remember. Come on!\n",
            "Well, thanks for that Stephen. That was a great lunch. Ah - you're welcome. My pleasure! Now come on, we've got to get a move on. Oh, wait a minute. They're nice. Which ones? Those boots? No, the shoes at the back - the black ones. Let's go in and have a look. What size are they? Why don't you try them on and see if they fit? Excuse me. Can I try these on, please? Have you got them in a size 6? Yes, sure. Thanks. Oh wait, they've got them in green, too. Maybe they're nicer. What do you think? Why don't you try them both on? Sorry, can I try them both on, please? The green and the black in a size 6. OK. Thanks. Let's sit down. Shoe shops make me tired. So, which ones do you prefer? Do you prefer the black ones or the green ones? They're both nice. But tell me which ones you like the best. Erm... OK then, the green ones. Well, what's wrong with the black ones? Nothing's wrong with the black ones. I said they're both nice. I think I prefer the black ones. OK then, if I say I prefer the black ones, can we just buy them and get out of here? Yeah, I think I'll get the black ones. Unless you prefer the green ones? Aaaargh! Come on! OK, I'll take the black ones please. OK, I'll see you later, then. OK, I'm going this way. See you! Hi there. Wow, such amazing clothes. Oh, this is nice. Can I try this on in a smaller size, please? Yes, certainly. Great, thank you. The changing rooms are just over there. This is wonderful. How much is it? That one's 110 pounds. It is beautiful but I'm not sure. Oh my gosh! Ashley!? What happened to you? Oh, hiya Stephen. Well, I decided to change my image. What do you think? Well, don't let Mum see you like that - it's her birthday party tonight. Don't worry, I'll change first. Are you ready for home? Yes, let's get out of here. Everybody's looking at you!\n",
            "It was Nicky's idea, but we all think it's going to be brilliant. As soon as the last exams have finished, we're going to decorate the main hall at school with paper streamers and Chinese lanterns and things. Steve had this idea of projecting photos of everyone onto a wall, like a slide show. And we've got Jo's brother, who's a professional DJ, coming along. Then there are three different bands lined up to play. Ours is the best, because we've been together longest and we've got a great bass player, although I say so myself, so we're on last. It's going to be cool. Every year there's a carnival in August in London. You've probably heard of it, the Notting Hill Carnival? So this year, me and my friends are going again. We went last year and we had such a fantastic time. It's all Afro-Caribbean, with people in amazing costumes and these brilliant steel bands. We don't go in costume, but we do dance a lot. It does get quite crowded, so you have to make sure you stick together. And you have to watch out for pick-pockets when there are so many people in the same place. But it's really good fun; it's like London becomes a different country. Even the police dance sometimes. We're going to hire a boat for the day and take it up the river. It's my grandparents' golden wedding anniversary, so the whole family is getting together. I'm really looking forward to seeing my cousins again. I haven't seen them for ages. We've got this huge picnic planned, with loads of different types of sandwiches and salads and an enormous cake. My dad has borrowed an ancient gramophone player, you know, what they had before CD players, and some old records. So as we go up the river we're going to listen to music from the time my grandparents got married - the swinging sixties! Two of my best friends have their birthday in the same week, so some of us have decided to have a surprise party for both of them. One of my friends, Sandra, has a big house, and her parents say we can use it. They're going away, luckily. It's at the end of October, so we're going to decorate the house with Halloween things, you know, spiders' webs and spooky things. We're going to make up an excuse to get the birthday girls to come round to the house - say we're going to help Sandra move some stuff, or something. Then, as soon as Sandra lets them in, we're going to turn the lights out and jump out at them! We just have to make sure nobody mentions anything on Facebook and gives away the surprise. There's a Royal Wedding in June - one of our princes is getting married - so it's a public holiday. Lots of people are having parties in squares and parks and places, and the people in our street decided to have one too. Well, it's a good excuse to have a party, isn't it? We're all going to take out tables and chairs and put them together in the middle of the road. We're going to stop cars coming through, obviously. We're all going to bring different dishes and share them round. There are quite a lot of different nationalities living on our street - people from India, China and different African countries - so the food should be really interesting. It'll be good to get to know more of the neighbours too.\n",
            "So, did you see the final episode last night? Of course! As if I would miss that! And? It was by far the best episode, definitely. Yeah, totally. The dragon at the end and all the special effects in that final scene were amazing. I loved that part! But I still don't think this series was as good as the others. Really? But you said you wouldn't want to miss it? I know, but still it's a lot more predictable than it used to be. But that's because the story has been told so well that all the characters are reaching their destiny now. I don't know before, anyone could die at any time so it was exciting! But, this series, no key characters died and we all knew they wouldn't. When Jaime fell in the water after the dragon attacked him, we knew he would make it somehow. And oh, surprise, Bronn jumps in and saves him. They did kill some characters in this series, though. What was that one's name? Exactly, see! You can't even remember who died! Hmm. The only thing I didn't like about this series was that it was shorter than the others. Seven episodes instead of ten. Maybe they spent all their money on that dragon! Right! I don't understand why they did it, as all the fans would happily watch ten episodes. I reckon that now they're not using the story in the books any more, they don't have as many ideas. That would explain why they're not being as brave with the story too. It's more like a Hollywood film than a TV show now. So, is Tyrion still your favourite character? You know surprisingly, I think my favourite might be Cersei. What?! She's so interesting! All the awful things she's done and the way she's just aiming for revenge, even though it won't make her happy. She still surprises us because we're expecting her to have a happy ending where she sees her mistakes and becomes a good person. But she never does, no matter what it costs her. She's unpredictable because we just can't believe anyone would be like her. I guess. You don't have to like a character for them to be your favourite!\n",
            "This is the River Thames. It is almost 346 kilometres long, and is the second longest river in Great Britain. It flows through London, and it's this part of the river that most tourists see. But there's more to the Thames than a trip down the river. The Romans built a settlement on the River Thames, and over the centuries it grew into the City of London, with a huge port. Ships from around the world brought food, goods and people to the capital. But by the 1980's, most of the docks had closed and the area became run-down. A lot of money has been invested in this huge riverside area. And today it's known as 'Docklands'. The old warehouses are now attractive apartments. There are new office buildings, shopping centres and leisure facilities, too. People enjoy living and working by the river. People also enjoy living on the water! This is a houseboat on the Thames. Hi Alistair. Hey Nick, welcome aboard. Thank you. So why do you live on a houseboat? I love being close to the water. And it's a brilliant place to invite friends over. What's it like to live on a boat? In the summer, it's beautiful. And in the winter, it's a bit cold. Could you give me a tour? Please. Follow me. So this is the kitchen. The bedroom. I like it. What's the best thing about living on the river? For me, it's being so close to nature. And it's really cheap. Is there anything you miss about living on dry land? I miss not being able to grow my own food and not having a garden. Do you think you will ever move? Only if I have to leave London. It's a really brilliant place to live in the city. The Thames has seen a lot of changes over the years. But perhaps the biggest change is still to come. This image is of the River Thames frozen over. It's not a real photograph. It's been created digitally. It shows the effect climate change may have on the river if temperatures drop significantly. They were created by two illustrators: Didier Madoc-Jones and Robert Graves. Didier, Tell us about this exhibition. We wanted to create postcards from the future - well-known views of London - to show people how it might look with the effects of climate change. Why does this one show the Thames frozen over? Well, some scientists think we might experience a new mini ice age with very cold winters and in the summer we'd experience flooding due to melting ice sheets. Do you think that could really happen? Nobody really knows. The point of the exhibition was to get people thinking about climate change and the future of London. The River Thames has changed over the centuries, and will continue to do so. But hopefully it will always be here for both local people and tourists to enjoy and explore.\n",
            "Dear Valentine, I want the world to know I love you Roses are red, violets are blue... I love you more than I can say It's Valentine's Day next week and I'm writing the cards I'm going to send. Aren't you going to send any? Oh, what's the point? I never get any back. I'm just so unlucky in love. Oh, you're just not meeting the right people. You should send more. The more cards you send, the more you receive. I don't think it works like that, Stephen. That's it, Ash. You need to join a dating agency. You know, where they find the perfect partner for you. Hmm I don't know, Stephen. I think they just take your money and match you up with the first person who comes along. And besides, I don't want a computer to make decisions for me. Well, what about speed dating? What? You know, speed dating. Where you meet lots of different people in one night. Like lots of little dates. Like an interview for a boyfriend. And... And? You get to choose someone. Or they get to choose you. I'm sure there's a speed dating night down at the club. It's a great chance to meet new people. And anyway it'll be a lot of fun. Well, OK then. But will you come with me? Of course I will. If you meet the man of your dreams, I need to check him out. Oh, Stephen! Wow, Stephen! There are a lot of people here. It seems really popular. Good. Lots of choice for you then. What's this bell for? You ring the bell when you don't want to speak to someone any more. Then they move on. Now, come on, Ashlie - sit up straight, smile. Stop it, Stephen! Don't forget, you have to make a good impression. Make some jokes, try and be nice. And if you get bored of them, just ring the bell. Ashlie, the lady's about to talk. Welcome to speed dating, the place where you will find love and romance and passion. Or perhaps just a new friend. Now, you ladies know what to do. You remain seated and these handsome gentlemen will come to your table. If he's not Mr Right, you can always ring the bell. Are you ready? Begin! Yes, so, I really like computers. Don't you? My favourite is the Wakefield CPC four six four nine hundred. I've got some photos here somewhere... Well, I'm really looking for a girl who likes doing housework. Someone who'd like to wash my clothes, do my ironing... Your hair's too dark. I like blonde hair. Have you ever thought about changing your hair colour? So Ashlie? How's it going? Terrible! So far they've been either totally boring or just weird! Hmm, well, I think you should keep trying. It's supposed to be fun, remember! Look, Stephen! He's very handsome. And tall. Go on, Stephen. Go, go, shoo. He's coming over... Hi! Hi. I'm Ted. I'm Ashlie.... or, or Ashlyn, in Irish. Or Ash, actually. My brother calls me Ash so that would be fine. But, well, my full name is Ashlie Bridget Alice Walker but you can call me...\n",
            "Stephen! For goodness' sake, you'll scare the postman away. Anyway, it's too early. The postman usually comes at 11. Yeah. You're right. He'll probably be late. He's got to carry all those cards for me. It's Valentine's Day today and Stephen takes it very seriously. He thinks he's going to get a lot of cards this year. I sent lots of cards, so I'll get lots of cards - simple. Stephen, it doesn't work like that. Anyway, I thought you were going to help me with my online profile. The speed dating didn't really work out. So now Stephen thinks I should try online dating to see if I can meet someone on the internet. Yeah, we're going to try it, Ash. Come on, let's take a picture. You'll need one for your profile. I'm a very good photographer. OK, then. Come on. OK, so now you have to describe yourself. So, I guess we could say, tall, beautiful, funny, clever, thin, successful... Or maybe you could just tell the truth? Stephen! OK, then. Which of these statements sounds most like me? Am I: A: Quiet and shy; B: Outgoing and chatty; C: Optimistic and confident? Ah, definitely optimistic and confident. Quiet and shy. OK, hobbies Tick all the boxes that are true for you. Let me see OK, playing cards, yes, gardening, yes, walking, yes... Err, hang on, Ashlie. I've never seen you do any of those things. Well, I'm trying to sound mature. You know, more grown up. Mature? You sound like an old lady! You're supposed to tell the truth... The postman. Just the one card, Stephen? It's not how many you get, Ashlie. It's the thought that counts. Ooh, listen to this, 'Your eyes are like diamonds that shine in the sky...' Stephen, is that your writing? Err, no. Err yes it is, Stephen. Did you send yourself this card? No, Ashlie. I notice you didn't get any. Anyway, how's your profile going? All finished actually. Now I just need to wait for a reply. Oh my goodness! That was quick! Quick. Open it, Ashlie. Let's see who you got. Strange photo... What's the message? What does he say? Well, his name's Barry... He says our interests are the same - they match perfectly. He wants to meet... Oh, do I hear wedding bells? Well, I think I should meet him. He sounds nice. But Stephen - you will come, won't you? Just to keep me safe? OK. But how will you recognise each other? We could wear a red flower or something? A red flower? That's a silly idea. You never wear flowers. Maybe you should wear something green. I know - a green scarf. OK. Let me message him. OK, done. Ooh, I'm going on a blind date! Stephen! What on earth are you wearing? Shh - I'm in disguise. Yes, but why? So no one recognises me. Right. OK. Look, I'll sit on that bench over there. You text me if you see him arrive. Remember, green scarf. Green scarves everywhere - I should have worn a flower Look right - Man in hat - Green scarf - Flowers Ashlie? Ashlie Walker? Oh, no. Ashlie, you asked for that. I told you, you needed to tell the truth. Right, that's it, Stephen! I give up on dating. Come on, grandma!\n",
            "Mum? Yes? You know that Economics exam I had last week? The one you didn't revise for? I did revise for it. I was working on it all weekend. Don't you remember? Oh, yes, I remember. Apart from going out until four in the morning, you mean? Well, I have to relax a little, even if I'm revising. Anyway, I didn't pass it. You failed it! But wasn't that an important one? Yeah, I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry too. What does that mean? Well, I'll probably have to retake the whole course. Oh, Ryan! It's a really expensive course. I'm not sure we can afford for you to take it again. Things are difficult enough as it is. I know, Mum. I'm sorry. I'll talk to the teacher again and see if I can retake it. Hi, Megan. How are you? Not feeling too good, actually. Oh? Why's that? Well, something terrible happened this morning What? Sorry, take your time, and tell me when you're ready. Well, I was playing with Bonzo in the garden with a ball, and the ball went over the hedge into the road, and Yes? And Bonzo jumped over the hedge after it and he got hit by a car. Oh, no! And is he? Yes. We took him to the vet's immediately, but there was nothing she could do. Oh, poor Bonzo. And poor you. I know how much he meant to you. We'd had him since he was a tiny puppy. He was like one of the family. I'm really sorry. At least he had a happy life. His life was too short! Well, yes, OK. I'm sorry, that was a really insensitive thing to say. I'll come round and see you later, OK? Hi, Dad. Hi, how's it going? Did you have a good day at work? Same as usual, really. What about you? Good day at school? Yeah, pretty good. Except for one little thing Why do I have a sinking feeling in my stomach? Do you remember you lent me your phone? Yes? Well, I was standing just outside school, texting Jack, and somebody ran past and grabbed it. You let someone steal my phone? I didn't let them. No, I suppose not. But did you know that that might happen? Is that a dangerous spot? Well, I had heard of that happening, but I'd forgotten. Anyway, I didn't think it would happen to me. No, OK. Did you see who it was? No. It was someone in a blue tracksuit, and there are loads of people who wear those. But there's a CCTV camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief's face. You reported it then? Well, not yet, but I will tomorrow. All right. Don't forget to report it tomorrow. I'll have a look at the insurance and see if it's covered.\n",
            "Come on, Ash! I'll drive. Give me the keys! Err, why won't it start? Did you leave the lights on last night? No, I didn't, Ashlie. The car won't start. And Stephen was supposed to give me a lift to the shops. I think it might be the battery or maybe that petrol thingy. OK, Stephen. Which one's the battery? Erm... is it that one? Erm, that's the radiator. How old is this car anyway? It's always breaking down! And we never know how to fix it. Come on. I'll see if I can find a mechanic and you can make us a nice cup of tea. They say it's going to cost a hundred and forty pounds to send out a mechanic! A hundred and forty pounds? That is it! We've got to learn how to fix that car ourselves. Oh, hey, have a look at this, Stephen: 'This course is intended to help people who want to save money on car service and repair bills.' Let me have a look. Ah, 'By the end of the course you will have a good understanding of car electrical systems, wheels, tyres and brakes.' Hmm, sounds good! Right. I'm going to call them to find out when the course starts. This was such a good idea, Stephen. Think of all the money we're going to save on car repairs. Yes, but I didn't expect to be in a classroom. I wanted to get my hands dirty and work on real cars. We will. But first we have to learn some theory. Theory, then practice. So, this is a standard four-stroke engine So, when the piston, here, reaches the top, the spark plug, here, will ignite the fuel and push the piston back down and then... This is so boring. When do we start with the real work? This is really useful. You have to know how it works before you can fix it.  ...inside here - so this is a water jacket. So that's what cools down as the piston's moving up and down, it creates friction, which creates heat. OK. So, out of the exhaust, through the centre-box and then through the rear exhaust. I'm exhausted. When are we going to do some real repairs? Shh. We're going to take a break now and then we're going to the workshop and we'll look at some brakes, OK? Ah! Finally! OK, we're going to start with some simple checks. They should only take a few minutes to do. I'll show you first and then you can have a go yourselves. We should have done this course years ago. We're going to save so much money. Yeah, this is more like it. OK, well done everyone. Let's have a look at what we've learnt so far. So, who can show me how to check the oil? Ashlie? Yeah. And how about radiators? Ooh yeah, me. I can do that. Be careful. Be careful! Stephen! I told you you needed to listen to the theory!\n",
            "That's it. Just need to tighten that up a bit. I think I've found what the problem was. It should be as good as new now. We've finished our car maintenance course and it's already paying off. The car is going better than ever. Which means you can give me a lift. Come on. Where are we going? I'll give you directions. Oh, my gosh, Stephen! What are we doing here? So, I was thinking. You know I keep asking if I can borrow your car? Yeah, so? And you're always giving me lifts? Yeah. Well, I thought it would be a good idea to get my own car. Stephen, you're always having these brilliant ideas. Cars are so expensive and you haven't got any money. Exactly. Da da! This is where I'm going to find my car. Come on. I want to introduce you to Gavin. Hi, Gavin. Good to see you. Hi, guys. So where do all these cars come from? Well, they're cars that have been in accidents or broken down. So, can we take a look around? Will that be OK? Sure. Let me know if you need any help. Thanks, Gavin. Thanks. Hey, Ash. What about this one? Stephen, that is such an old banger. It hasn't even got a boot. What about this one? Stephen, that's so big. And it's got a smashed bonnet. OK, this is it! This is the one. Are you sure, Stephen? With our new skills, Ash, it won't take long to get it looking as good as new. We only did a course for beginners. We're not experts. And this needs an expert! And that's what Gavin's here for. Gavin! So what do you think, Gavin? I think you must be crazy, Stephen. It's such an old heap. Yeah, she's great, isn't she? So where do we start? Let's take a look at the engine. Err, maybe we should start on the outside first. No, Ash, we really should look at the engine. Gavin, the engine's the easy part. Come on. Don't be boring. Come on, Ashlie. Let's get started! What do you think, Ash? It needs a few more finishing touches, but I think it's really coming along. I think it looks great. I can't wait to take it for a drive. What do you think, Gavin? I think it might be time to take a look at the engine. Oh, OK. I guess we should take a look. Maybe top up the oil and other stuff before we take it for a spin. But don't take too long. I want to get it out on the road. Erm, guys What's up? Problem with the engine? You could say that, Stephen. Oh no!\n",
            "The English countryside: a great place to find peace and quiet somewhere to enjoy the scenery and enjoy nature and fresh air and famous also for the dramatic battles of the past. By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, I call on all you people of Corfe Castle to send into this garrison now all your weapons. God save the King! This is Corfe Castle in the south of England, where today people are turning back the clock by more than 350 years to the time of the English Civil War. The English Civil War was the last war to be fought on English soil. King Charles I was fighting for his throne. His supporters were called the Royalists. They were fighting against the Parliamentarians, who didn't want the King to be in charge. And who won? Well, keep watching to find out! But why do these members of the English Civil War Society come here? Meeting up with old friends, having a good time and visiting places that probably I wouldn't go to normally. Bringing history alive for the general public. Well, I come as part of a family. We've got three young children and they love the whole atmosphere. I got the chance to go into the Royalist camp. Stephen Burden plays the part of a Royalist officer. Stephen, tell me a little bit about what you're wearing today. My clothes show that I'm a gentleman because they're very high-status. I wear gloves to protect my hands and I'm also carrying many weapons. I've got my sword here, I have my pistol and if all else fails I have a dagger to finish people off with. And also we have various things, as you can see in here, including real coins of the period. Do have a look at one. Congratulations! This person takes the King's shilling! We have a new recruit! Sergeant, take this person, take them and get some decent clothes on them. We're going to make a soldier out of them. Make way for the new recruit! Make way! And now I feel like I really have stepped back in time. The Battle of Corfe Castle was a real event which took place here over three centuries ago. Time for me to join the action! The muskets use real gunpowder and are incredibly loud. Eventually, the castle falls to the control of the Parliamentarians. That was so much fun, being involved actually in the action! Our side was beaten, but, boy, was that a really good experience! Remember I said I'll tell you what happened in the English Civil War? The Royalists lost the war and the King lost his head literally. Eleven years later, his son regained the throne and Britain has had a royal family ever since. When you look, history is all around us.\n",
            "Extreme sports are popular all over the UK. Not just in the mountains of Snowdonia or Scotland. But what attracts people to these sports? Is it adventure or danger? People who enjoy fast and dangerous sports, like white-water rafting, are called thrill seekers or adrenalin junkies. I'm at the National Water Sports Centre in Nottingham in the centre of England and this is the white-water course. Seven hundred metres of foaming water with drops or rapids. And the skill is to stay afloat in the rough water. I'm here to meet Pas Blackwell, a white-water rafting expert, and to find out why so many people enjoy the thrills and spills of this extreme sport. Hi, Pas. Hi, Carmen. So this is a specially built course, but you raft on rapids all around the world. What do you most enjoy about white-water rafting? I really enjoy being outdoors and on the water. I really enjoy the freedom of just you and nature and I really enjoy the challenge. So why do people like dangerous sports? I think people like to push themselves - to see how far they can go - to really test themselves, against the elements, water and air. So, are you an adrenalin junkie? I don't think of myself as an adrenalin junkie, but I do really enjoy the rush of trying to get from the top to the bottom and get through situations that occur out on the river. In the countryside there are lots of wide open spaces and lots of extreme sports to choose from. But what do adrenalin junkies do in the city? Well, parkour, sometimes called free running, is becoming popular in London. Parkour started in France. And the idea is to get from one place to the other as fast as possible; jumping and climbing over whatever is in the way. So I've come to a parkour class in West London to find out what it's all about. Rebecca Ahmed has been doing parkour for more than a year. So Rebecca, why do you like parkour? It's really fun, it's original and it keeps me fit. That's why I come. Do you need any special equipment? Not really, we just use what's around us like steps, railings and trees, but as long as you've got a good pair of trainers, you're fine Is it difficult? I wouldn't say it's difficult - it's more about the fear. If you're not scared you can do it. I'm not sure I've got the balance for parkour. Extreme sports can be dangerous, but they're also lots of fun.\n",
            "Stephen. Will you help me? I think we're here and we need to be there. Let me see. No, we're here and we should be there. We should have turned left back there. We've come away to the countryside for a weekend on a farm, but we're having a bit of trouble finding it. No, we aren't, Ash. That has to be it there. We need to turn left back there. Come on, jump in. Why won't it start? I don't know. Did you put any petrol in the car? No. I thought you were going to put petrol in the car. No. You said you were going to put petrol in the car. Oh, this is hopeless. We'll have to walk. This is your fault, Stephen. Hang on, there's something coming. We can get a lift. Hey! Excuse me. Hello there. Do you know where Strawberry Farm is? Yes, I'm going in that direction. Hop on! Thanks. ---- Go straight down there, along the path and across the field. Great. Thank you very much. It can't be much further, can it? I'm getting really hungry. Keep going. What are you eating? Hmm? Oh. Blackberries. There are loads of them. These are really delicious. I love blackberries. We should get going. Before it gets dark. Stephen, this is horrible. Arrgh! What was that? I think I just stood in something. It smells terrible. I think it might be... Ashlie, stop moaning! We're going round in circles. We should go that way. We're completely lost, aren't we? What if we don't find it? What was that? It's just an owl, Stephen. I hate the countryside. Let's get out of here. Look, there's a light over there. Stephen! What? Look over there. There's someone in the field. What are they doing there? I'm scared. Hello! Excuse me! Why is he ignoring us? I don't know. This is weird. I'm scared, Stephen. Let's walk a little faster. Come on, Ash! You must be Stephen and Ashlie. What's happened to you? Quick! Let us in! There's a strange man outside. Let me in!\n",
            "Morning! Morning, Stephen. Did you sleep OK? Yeah, great. All that fresh country air. It's really peaceful here. Mmm, it's lovely. Are you ready for breakfast? Oh, that would be great. Well, there are lots of eggs. Are there? Where are they? They're not here. You have to go and get them. But we must be miles away from a supermarket. Not from a supermarket. This is a working holiday. We have to work to pay for our stay. What? Here you are. You'll need this. It smells awful in here. Oh, I've got one. And another one. I can't find any. Try looking under a chicken, Stephen. Just pick one up. Stephen! Right. Let's cook breakfast. Did you get any? Yes! I got loads! Mmm, these are wonderful. They're much better when they're fresh. You can't beat fresh eggs. Right. As soon as breakfast is out of the way, we've got to do some work. Right, we need to shift those bales from over there to over there. Stephen, this looks like your kind of work. I'm going to pick some vegetables. Uh? Well, someone has to think about lunch. OK, Stephen. Now can you put those up there? This is really hard work! Stephen, look at your hair! I'm exhausted. Well, I've almost got lunch. We just need one more thing. Come with me. Right, all we need now is some potatoes. Here's your fork, start digging. That's it! Great. Try over here. Lovely. Just need a few more and then we'll be ready for lunch. Keep going. I'm exhausted. Isn't it your turn to dig? Right, yeah, I think we've got enough now. Come on, let's make some lunch. We should have gone to the supermarket. You have a rest and I'll make some lunch. Listen, I need your help. What's wrong? I've lost a sheep. It's escaped from the top field. A sheep has escaped? We can go, but how do we catch it? I'll make some lunch, you do the sheep. Oh, did you catch the sheep? Yes. Come and see it. It's huge! Stephen!\n",
            "My favourite thing has to be my new tablet. It's really light and quite small, so I take it with me everywhere. I'm always writing messages to friends and it's big enough to do college work on it too. It takes really good photos, and I play games and listen to music on it as well, of course. I often download films onto it and watch them in bed. My mum says I'm addicted, because I'm always on it. I even read things on it at breakfast time. I'm not allowed to at dinner time, though. I have to be polite and talk to people then. 'Welcome back to real life,' my mum says. My favourite thing? Does my cat count as a thing? She's not really a thing, but anyway. She's a really beautiful little cat. I've had her since she was four months old. You know how some cats are really independent and hardly talk to you? I know cats don't really talk, but you know what I mean. Well, she's not like that at all. She's really affectionate and comes up to me as soon as I get home, purring away like mad. She makes a lot of noise for a tiny thing. She loves being stroked and comes and curls up next to me when I'm on the sofa. She's great company. My new scooter! It's quite small, but fun, and just what I needed for getting around the city. I used to have quite a long walk to the metro, then a longish walk at the other end to get to college. But now I can just whiz there on my scooter. And there's no problem parking, there's always space for it. You have to be careful with the cars and lorries - they don't always see you - and when it rains the surface of the road is terrible, it gets really slippery. But in general it's perfect for me, and I can fit a friend on the back too - I've got an extra helmet for a friend. It's great. Riding along makes me feel so free. This might sound a bit old-fashioned, but my sewing machine is my favourite thing. I'm studying fashion and love making things, as well as designing them. I also love clothes myself and often buy second-hand clothes - everyone loves the “vintage” look at the moment - and then I adapt them to my size. It's much easier using a machine to do that than doing it by hand. I do alterations for my mum and my sister too. If I don't make it as a designer, I suppose I can always set up my own alterations and customising business. Customising clothes, by taking things off and adding things on, is actually very creative, so I wouldn't mind that. My set of Japanese knives. That sounds a bit sinister, doesn't it, but I'm not a murderer or anything. They're chef's knives and the best ones come from Japan. Cooking is my new hobby. I got into it when I started watching Masterchef on TV. Then I went to an evening class for beginners, and I haven't looked back since. I try and have a dinner for between four and eight friends every two or three weeks. That gives me something to work towards and I always do new dishes so they can try them out and give me feedback. It's quite an expensive hobby if you use good ingredients, but now my friends help towards the cost. They still get a good meal for a very low price.\n",
            "This is London, and behind me are the Houses of Parliament. Parts of these buildings are more than nine hundred years old. This is where the laws of the UK are debated and created. The United Kingdom is actually made up of four different countries; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each nation has its own culture and heritage. The population of England is around fifty million people. The English are known for drinking tea, The Queen and talking about the weather. But what are we really like? The English are a tolerant people. Woman 1: They're just enchanting. Woman 2: The English people are very nice. Woman 3: They're so polite and so friendly. Scotland is in the North of Britain. Just over five million people live there. It's been part of the UK since 1707. Edinburgh is the capital city and home to the Scottish Parliament. The Parliament building is a work of art in itself! Scotland has some unique customs: wearing tartan kilts, playing the bag-pipes and tossing the caber - a very large post. For over sixty years, The Edinburgh Festival has celebrated art, theatre and culture. Wales is on the western edge of Britain. It also used to be a separate country but has been part of the UK for over four hundred years. Nearly three million people live in Wales. One of its symbols is a red dragon, found on the national flag. The Welsh Assembly is in the capital city, Cardiff. The Welsh are proud of their language, and twenty per cent of the people speak Cymraeg. Most signs are in English and Welsh. Singing is an important tradition in Wales. People working in coal mines in Wales originally formed male-only choirs. They are still popular today. Well I joined the choir because I met a couple of students - Welsh boys - they brought me here - love singing - I'm in the choir. The choir sings in Welsh, so you have to be willing to try and pronounce the language, but you definitely don't have to be Welsh to be a member of the choir. Northern Ireland is also part of the United Kingdom. The country is home to just under two million people. The capital is Belfast and for many years, Northern Ireland was a place of conflict. This beautiful country was considered a dangerous place to visit. The troubles lasted until recent years when the peace process brought both sides together. Now, both sides share power in the Northern Ireland assembly. The flag most often used for Northern Ireland shows the red hand - a symbol with a long history in this part of Ireland - and a crown which shows links to the rest of the UK. The culture in Northern Ireland is rich in myth and legend. One story says that the rocks forming the Giant's Causeway were thrown there by an Irish giant during a fight with a Scottish giant. Irish dancing is popular in Northern and Southern Ireland and has been exported around the world. Irish dancing is special because you have to have good posture, arms by your side and crossed feet. I love Irish dancing because it's great exercise and a lot of fun. The four countries of the UK have different traditions. But those differences are also strengths and make the UK what it is today.\n",
            "What's the time? She should be here by now. It's five past nine. She'll be here in a minute. We're at Paddington Station with our friend Tristan. Hi. And we're waiting for Tristan's friend Jay Marie to arrive from the airport. She's just flown in from the States. Here she is! Hi, Jay Marie! Hi! Stephen, Ashlie, this is Jay Marie. Hello. Hi! I've heard so much about you guys. It's great to meet you. It's so awesome to be in London. Ah, great. So are you guys ready for some sightseeing? Sure. Sounds cool. OK - let's drop off your bags, and we're ready to go. Cool! OK, guys. So we're going to take a double-decker tour around the city. A what? A double-decker. You know, a bus with two floors. It should be here any minute now. Ah! Oh! Oh no, Stephen! I'm so sorry. All over your pants. My pants? No, no, no. It just went on my trousers. I'm fine. Oh, look. I think that must be our bus coming. The one without a roof? Yeah, so we can see more. Oh, great! Come on, let's jump on. All aboard! Ladies and gentlemen, to your left is St Paul's Cathedral... I didn't catch any of that. What did he say? I think he's talking about that building over there. It was on this site that the original St Paul's was destroyed... No. I didn't get a single word of that. Look, tell you what. I've got my guide book here. Why don't I take over as your personal guide? Well, OK! OK, let's see. Piccadilly Circus. Did you know that Piccadilly Circus was built in 1819 to connect Regent Street and the major shopping street of Piccadilly? The fountain with its famous statue of the Greek god Eros was added in 1893. Piccadilly Circus... Oh Stephen, that is so boring! Listen, I've just looked it up on my phone and here is an interesting fact for you. Did you know that British people say, 'It's like Piccadilly Circus' to mean that somewhere is busy and crowded and full of people? Really? Err, Ashlie. I've got the guide book. A book for guides! Whatever, Stephen. Did you know that Tower Bridge was built between 1886 and... And you know that song 'London Bridge is falling down, falling down'? Well, most people think it's about this bridge, but actually it's about another bridge. And it was painted blue to match the colour of the Queen's eyes. Trafalgar Square. Did you know the column is 51.5 metres tall from the ground to the tip of the Admiral's hat? It was built between 1840 Did you know that one of the statues in the Square changes once a year to a new piece of art? At the moment, it's that big blue one over there. All right. That's it! Give me that phone. Give me that book! Jay Marie! Jay Marie! Who do you want to be your guide? Me with my expert guide book or Ashlie with her stupid internet facts? Huh? Well I was just listening to the audio tour. Sorry guys! What? Jay Marie!\n",
            "OK. So, what time is it? I don't know. I don't have a watch. Ah. It's almost one o'clock. OK, here's the plan. Ashlie and Jay Marie, you two are going to go and have afternoon tea. And Tristan, why don't you and I go up Big Ben? Err, Stephen I don't think you just 'go up' Big Ben. You can if you've booked. Brilliant! I've always wanted to go up there! OK. And we'll meet back here later. Have a good time! See you guys! Bye! Bye! Wow! I can't wait for this Wow! Come on, I'll race you. 31, 32, 33, 34. 35, 36... 98, 99, 100. This is harder than I thought. You all right, Tristan? Stephen! I'm up here! Hurry up, slow coach! Oh, this is lovely, Ashlie! I've always wanted a traditional English afternoon tea. Yes, it's nice, isn't it? Though we don't do it every day. Really? I thought afternoon tea was a meal for you. Breakfast, lunch, tea? Well, actually, it's a bit confusing. Some people call 'lunch' 'dinner' and 'dinner' 'tea' but not like afternoon tea like this. And then of course, there's the tea that you drink. Hmm. You'll have to explain it to me later. This looks delicious. Wow! Look, you can see all the clock faces. So here we are now in the clock room. This is called the chime train. It governs the four chime bells, which play the Westminster chimes. We all know the tune: ding dong ding dong. You're all familiar with that. Well, that's what's going to play now. So here we are. The bells themselves. And that bell there is Big Ben himself. I thought the tower was called Big Ben? No, it's just the name of the bell. Yes, in fact the tower is called the Elizabeth Tower. That's right. And watch out, guys, the bells are going to ring any second now. Hey, wow! It's already three o'clock. I bet it's loud where Stephen is. Let me call him. Hello, Ashlie. I can't hear you. It's really loud up here. Oh, that was cool. Can you hear the bells from where you are? Err, no. Are you having fun? Yeah, the stairs were really hard work but it's really interesting from up here. Oh, the tour's moving on. See you later. OK, Bye Bye. More sandwiches? Oh, go on then. Stephen, we're running out of time. We need to head off and meet the girls. OK. Wait a second. There's just one thing I've always wanted to do. You guys are so lucky to be living in London. So many beautiful buildings to see. Yeah, we love it here. I just wish we had more time to enjoy the city, instead of working all the time. I wonder how Stephen and Tristan are getting on? They should be down by now. Hey, Ashlie! What's that? Hmm - I'm not sure. Stephen?! Ashlie!!!\n",
            "Wow, I haven't done this for years. This is a great place to skate. Stephen's come skateboarding, and me and Poppy have come along to watch. Off you go then. Hey, Ashlie, watch this! Be careful, Stephen. That looks dangerous! Hello? Oh, hiya, Pete. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just at the skate park... What are you up to? Poppy! Stephen, watch out! Pete, I have to go. Stephen's fallen over. I think he's hurt himself. Argh. My ankle. Are you OK? Argh, my ankle. Is Poppy OK? Yeah, she's fine. Oh, I'm so sorry, Stephen. Where does it hurt? Is it really bad? Just here. It really hurts. Do you think you can walk? Ow! Come on. Let me help you up. Let's get you home. Do you think I need to go to hospital? In an ambulance? Be a brave boy, Stephen. All right, I'll be OK. Give me a hand, would you? Ashlie! Ash! Ashlie! Can you pass me some more ice, please? It's still very painful, you know. Here you go. Thanks, Ash. Ooh. Actually, Ashlie, that's a bit cold. Well, it is ice, Stephen. Ah, well maybe a cup of tea will make me feel better. Do you think you could get me a cup of tea, please, Ashlie? Oh, come on, Stephen! It still really hurts. OK, then. Here you go. Oh, Ash, you're very kind. Would you mind getting me a chocolate biscuit? Stephen! I am not here to run around for you like a servant. Well, it's kind of your fault I hurt my ankle. Do you think it might be broken? Why is it my fault? Well, if you hadn't let go of Poppy, I wouldn't have hurt myself. Stephen, that is so unfair. Oh, come on, Ash. Just one biscuit. They're in the kitchen. Oh, OK then. But if your ankle isn't better by the morning, I'm taking you to hospital. Aargh. My elbow. I think it's broken. Ashlie! Right, that's it. I'm taking you to hospital. Come on. In an ambulance? No, Stephen. Not in an ambulance.\n",
            "Accident and Emergency. This is what we need. Right. Because this is an emergency. No, but it is an accident. Come on, you wait here, Poppy. Come on, then. Let's go. Hi! Hello. Can I help you? Yes. I think I've broken my ankle and my elbow. I think I need an X-ray. Can I have your name, please? It's Walker. Stephen Walker. OK. Thank you. Could you wait over there, please, and someone will see you as soon as they can. Great, thanks. Mr Walker? Yes. The doctor's ready to see you now. Great. Good luck. OK, Mr Walker. We're going to X-ray your elbow and your ankle. But first the nurse just needs to do some tests. OK, can I just have a look at your tongue, please. Just open your mouth. Yes, but it's my ankle. Yes, but we just need a quick examination, Mr Walker. If you open wide. Now say 'ahhhh'. Ahhhhhh. Yes, very good. We're just going to have a quick listen. If you could turn round for me. My elbow really hurts. That's nice. Very good. Almost finished. If you could roll up your sleeve, please. Ah, my elbow No, I just need to take your blood pressure. Yeah, that seems normal. Right, you say it's your ankle then, is it? Yes. And my elbow. I fell off my skateboard, you see OK. Well, let's look at your elbow first, shall we? Can you tell me where it hurts? Yeah, just here. And does it hurt when I do this? Aaghh! OK. And how about your ankle? OK. Is that painful? Aaghh! Yes! Well, I suppose we'd better get an X-ray. Here, take this down to the X-ray unit. Are you lost? We're looking for the X-Ray Unit. Yeah, follow me. Great. Thank you. Do you think my ankle's broken, Ash? I don't know, Stephen. I'm not a doctor. If you hadn't let Poppy run away Stephen, it's not my fault you fell over. Mr Clumsy. It might be months before I can walk properly again. Oh, Stephen. You'll have to look after me. X-Ray Technician: Your form, please? Well, I'm pleased to tell you that neither your ankle nor your elbow is broken. Neither of them? Not even a little bit? Neither of them. They're both bruised, but not broken. You'll need to rest them for a couple of weeks. So no skateboarding. I'll give you a prescription for some painkillers. Take one of these three times a day with food. Thank you, Doctor. Come on then, Stephen. Let's get you out of here, eh? No way. Come on you. Come on. Let's get you home, eh?\n",
            "Ice cream is a favourite food the world over. I'm visiting farms on the south coast of England that specialise in making this ice-cold treat. We're going to follow the process of how it's made right the way from the cow to the ice cream cone. Hello. Do you want some? Welcome to Kent, a county known as the Garden of England because of all its farm produce. And this is Solley's Farm, where milk is transformed into ice cream. The flavours made here are sold all over Britain. Stephen Solley is the owner. So, Stephen, what goes into making ice cream? Milk and cream. Well, our milk we have a Guernsey milk which is a lovely rich creamy milk and we add cream to that and quite a lot of sugar so it gives us a nice body for a nice rich ice cream. Why do you think everyone loves ice cream so much? I think it reminds them of the lovely summer days in midsummer, and seeing the children eating their ice creams and putting it all over their faces and everybody's happy so it gives you a happy moment in time. The journey begins on a neighbouring dairy farm where the milk is produced. It then comes here to be made into ice cream. First, it is heated to kill off any bacteria. Oh - it smells great! It's then cooled and stirred to create very smooth ice cream. It's mixed with the flavours and then poured into the cartons. And they fill up about 1800 tubs of ice cream every day. And inside this giant freezer is where all the ice cream is stored, and I can tell you it's pretty cold. From here the ice cream is sent out all over the country. But what flavours are there? Well, Stephen has some for me to try. So Stephen, I'm going to guess which flavours you've got here. Right, so if we start on this one and see how you find that... OK. Definitely vanilla. Yes, well done. You got that right. Nutty. No... cinnamon. Cinnamon, well done, yes, that's right. OK, it looks pretty. It's not strawberry. Cherry. That's right. Well done. There are thousands of different flavours. But what do people like about ice cream? I love ice cream. My favourite flavour would be caramel. It's nice on a hot day... Good variety of flavours. It looks pretty cool. It's fresh and it's sweet, so I like it. Kids love it. Grandparents love it. Parents love it. Everybody loves it. I don't really like ice cream. You don't like ice cream? I eat it, but I don't really like it. I wouldn't choose it. OK. So not everyone likes it. A lot of ice cream ends up in vans like this one. Ice cream vans are a common sight around Britain in summer, and how do you get people to come and buy your ice cream? Well, like this! I've always wanted to do that... And while I'm here waiting, I might as well help myself to another ice cream. Very nice!\n",
            "She lives next door and she's always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She'd tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn't bake so much. She's started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It's funny how she's changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it's amazing. I don't see her so often now, but she's always the same person however much her lifestyle changes. He's four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we'd never talk to each other during school hours. But now we're older it's a lot better, although I'll always be the little one, and that's annoying sometimes. He's taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn't have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he's working he's really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It's always good to see him. We've known each other since we were five and we've always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we're good at different things. I'm good at languages and Laura's good at maths. That's good though - it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I'm probably going to study in London and she's going to Manchester, but I'm sure our relationship won't change. His family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I'd been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we'd spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We're still friends on Facebook but we don't really have much contact. I can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I'd just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We've been together ever since. Well, it's only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn't very long, but it seems like ages to me. We've got such similar personalities and so much in common. I'm sure we'll stay together forever.\n",
            "Hi, Tristan! Hi, guys. Great to see you! Good to see you! We thought we'd come and try out your new place. Ah, that's good. Have you got a table for two? Yeah, sure. Over there. Perfect. Thanks. I'll be with you in a minute. Mmm This looks great. Thank you, Stephen. Ashlie's been working hard recently, so I've invited her out for lunch. He doesn't usually take me out for lunch. OK, OK. Come on, what shall we have? Oh, I don't know. It all looks delicious. Maybe some soup. That looks so good. Thanks for coming in, guys. Listen, sorry to ask you this, but can you do me a favour? Sure, of course! What is it? We've almost run out of coffee. I need to go to the supermarket to buy some more. I need someone to look after the place while I'm away. Would you mind? Help out in the café? Well, I suppose so. If you're really stuck. It's pretty quiet today. You probably won't have to do anything. I'm sure we'll be fine. It won't be for very long. Just ten minutes. I've just got to pop out to the supermarket. Don't worry about it, Tristan. Look, there aren't many people here. We'll keep an eye on everything. Great! Thanks, guys. Oh, by the way, the cook's gone home sick, so if anyone orders any food, you can take care of things? Great. Thanks, guys. See you later. Bye. This is going to be fun. How about you take the orders in the café, and I'll be in the kitchen? Are you sure, Stephen? It'll be fine. I'll go and make a start in the kitchen, you bring the orders to me. OK. Hi. Can I take your order? Hi, can I have a cheese sandwich and a green salad, please? No problem. And what would you like? I'd like some carrot cake and a cup of tea, please. I've got that. It shouldn't be long. Stephen? Er, are you OK, Stephen? What's going on? Don't worry, it's all under control. Where are my food orders? Let me see. One cheese salad, one carrot sandwich and a green tea, I think. OK, I've got that. Cheese, carrot, tea, coming up. Hi. Could I have a coffee? Coffee. And I think I'll have a tomato soup, please. Tomato soup. Coming up. Hi. What would you like? Excuse me, we've been waiting for ages. Where's our food? I'm really sorry, I'm sure it won't be long. I'll go and see how the chef's doing. Stephen! I'm going as fast as I can! Here you are. A cheese sandwich, a green salad, a carrot cake and a cup of tea. Are you sure that's right, Stephen? Wasn't it cheese salad, a green tea and a carrot sandwich? Oh, I can't remember now. I'm sure this is all wrong. All right. Sorry for the delay. A cheese sandwich and a green salad? Thank you. And carrot cake and a cup of tea? That's for me. There you are. Enjoy your food. Hi, Ashlie. Hi, Stephen. Hi! Hi, Tristan. Sorry I've been so long. There were queues in the supermarket. I've got the coffee. I'll put it in the kitchen. Don't worry. I'll put that in the kitchen for you. Nooo! The customers look happy. Ah, we did OK. I thought it was going to be a lot harder. You guys really did do a good job. I really appreciate it. The thing is, erm, if you're interested... Interested in... in what? Well, you know my dad. You remember him, don't you? Well, he's got this little business and he needs a little bit of help. That sounds great, Tristan. We'd love to help out. Ashlie, I think we should be going. Ah, yes. Nice to see you, Tristan. Bye!\n",
            "It's so nice to be here in Brighton. Tristan told us to be here at 10 o'clock, right? Yes, he said 10. What was the name of the place? Erm, it says here Mr Whippy, Brighton. I guess it's a café here on the sea front. Near the pier. That's what it says here. Oh, Ashlie! Amazing! An ice cream van! Isn't it brilliant? I've always wanted to spend the day in an ice cream van, Ash. Just think, all the ice cream you can eat. It's going to be great. Stephen, we're here to help out. We're here to help Tristan's dad sell the ice cream - not eat it all ourselves. This must be the ice cream making machine. What do you think, Stephen? That's right. Let's make some ice cream. This is going to be so much fun. First, get a cone, then pull this lever There you are, my first ice cream. Mmm delicious! Well, Stephen, now what? It doesn't look like there are many people around. When I was a kid, I always dreamed of having my own ice cream van. This is fantastic. But there's something missing. Oh, look. There's a customer coming OK, OK, I'll handle this. Hello, how can I help you? Hello there. Erm Do you sell burgers? Er, no. This is an ice cream van. Do you sell hot dogs? No, this is an ice cream van. Do you sell popcorn? No. Would you like an ice cream? Hmm, I don't like ice cream. It doesn't look like we're going to sell any ice cream today. We need to get some customers. Someone must want an ice cream. I know! I'm going to see if I can get some people to come and buy some ice cream. I'm going to invent some new ice cream flavours. I think people want something different. How are you going to do that? Look, we can add sweets, create new flavours. We can come up with something different. I'm going to do some marketing, you know, do some promotion, so people know we're here. How many ice creams have you sold, Stephen? Is my marketing working? Ah, well, look at these. Here are my new inventions! You are joking! No. And look at the amazing double-ended ice cream, with two cones. Oh look. There's a customer coming our way. I think they must have seen my sign. I'd like an ice cream, please. Can I interest you in any of our new flavours? There are lots of different kinds, as you can see. No, thanks. I'd just like a normal ice cream, please. Erm sorry. We seem to have run out. Oh Stephen!\n",
            "For me, I see education and knowledge to be more important than property and wealth. Because the world keeps on changing, keeps on changing every day. So if you discover knowledge, you can do something to help yourself in the near future. If you have knowledge, you have everything in this world. I'm from Ghana, West Africa. Sometimes I remember my past, try to make a picture. I came from Ghana to Greece when I was 16 years old. Because I was alone, I didn't have anyone to take care of me. The journey was not easy at all. I remember I slept in the bush for three days and three nights without food and water. And the smuggler told me to board the boats without a life jacket. So, the next morning I was in Greece and I was happy, but I was sad too, because I really escaped death. Before Coronavirus, all my day was very good. I remember when I had the opportunity to enter the American Community School, I said, 'Now I can achieve my aim, my objectives and my dream too.' I was worried, because nobody knows how long Coronavirus would exist or go. I thought, I don't have family, I don't have anybody, I'm alone. Now if I got sick, nobody's there to help me. So I have to be extra careful and take extra care of my life, because life is precious. Sometimes, like, I need someone to share my problem with, someone to talk to. Sometimes I feel like this world has no place for me. So, all these negative thoughts come to my mind. And, so, like, I decided, no, I have to do something to help myself. So, if I wake up in the morning, like seven, I use, like, 40 minutes to do exercise. Oh, I do push-ups, very hard. Push-ups, plank and donkey kicks. Actually I learned from online, YouTube. If I go to YouTube, I see people exercising, so I do the exact thing. From nine o'clock to two I have to concentrate on the online classes. I live with three friends. I know that at five o'clock the guys are out, so I can concentrate more. Sometimes I have to wait for them so that they are so deeply asleep. That time may be around 1.30 to 3 a.m. And this time I use to learn. Actually, it's very hard. I don't sleep much. I put on the alarm so that I'll not oversleep to meet the next day. So it was very hard for me, but I learned how to manage my time. That makes me very happy now. For my advice, try to figure out, make a schedule for your life. And have some specific time that I do certain things. So this helped me to see how important time management is in school. There's only one thing I want to be. I want to own my organisation to help other kids. To help kids to be self-motivated and to believe in themselves like all hope is not lost. I learned to give and to help people. Not because I have much, because I've known the feeling of not having. So I realised, like, no condition on this earth is permanent. I know this Coronavirus will soon be over and I will continue my education. You have to believe in yourself, that you can do something. Hello, everyone. Thank you for studying with me in Greece. Now I'm curious about how you motivate yourself during a tough time. Let me know in the comments below.\n",
            "It's the height of the music festival season here in the UK. Some of the biggest bands in the world are performing to huge crowds in the open air. This is Reading Festival where over three days more than 200 acts are performing across eight stages. I'm going to be following one of Britain's top bands, British Sea Power, as they prepare for their show tonight. Late in the afternoon, the band arrive backstage by tour bus. British Sea Power have a very distinctive sound. They mix the influences of poetry and the English landscape with an indie rock sound. I spoke to the band's vocalist and guitarist, Scott Wilkinson. What's the atmosphere like at a music festival? Erm, they're all very different, they have their own character. This one was traditionally it was kind of like the rock festival. Because you see a lot of music in one weekend, maybe see some new music that you wouldn't buy a ticket to go and see, see something by accident, you know. For the band, there's lots of hanging around before their concert later tonight. But I wanted to find out what life is like for the fans. When you come to a festival, there's a few things you need to bring with you. A lot of people stay overnight, so of course you need a tent. After dark, a torch comes in handy. The British weather is very unpredictable, so a lot of water, because it might be hot, but if it rains, of course, you need your waterproofs, an umbrella and the all-important wellies. It's also very important to remember where your tent is. There are thousands of them. So what's brought so many people to the Reading Festival? Music, I've got friends and having an absolutely wicked time. I just really like the atmosphere, and there's so much here... meeting new people, listening to good music It was getting dark, so after looking around, I headed backstage again to see how the band were doing. There are a lot of last-minute preparations before the band can perform. Just before they went on stage, I spoke to guitarist Martin Noble. Martin, what's it like to perform at a music festival? Erm, it's really exciting. You know, you rehearse all the time in a small dark room, and then this is your chance to actually finally get out there and play to your audience. You're just about to go on stage soon. Are you nervous? You know, sometimes you get the nerves, but you know, if you can see the crowd are up for it, then there's nothing to worry about. The band are just minutes away from performing. They're doing their last-minute sound check now, and from here the crowd looks amazing.\n",
            "OK, are we all together? Right, next we're going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos. Llamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the biggest animal - they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds. Don't they spit at people, though? Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don't want to mistreat a llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you. Uuuugggh! But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are usually gentle and curious. OK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They've got smaller faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one's face. Aaaah! The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep's wool. There's a big demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry. Right, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas. Vicuñas are very elegant and graceful creatures. Look at this one. She's beautiful. Mmmm. She's lovely. Have you heard of the Incas? The ancient rulers of Latin America who lived in the Andes? Well, they wore clothes made from vicuña wool - only the royal family were allowed to wear the wool. It is even softer than alpaca wool but vicuñas can only be shorn of their wool every three years. For that reason the wool's very expensive. And, lastly, we have the guanacos. They are similar to the vicuñas, but larger and stronger. They are capable of surviving at over 4,000 metres in the Andes. When they are in the desert they survive by licking the water off the cacti and other desert plants. Right, any questions? I think I can hear this llama making a noise. Ah, yes. That could be the llama humming. They don't open their mouths, they just make this strange noise. They hum when they are stressed, or the opposite, feeling relaxed. Can llamas live in the UK? Yes, there are quite a lot of llamas and alpaca in the UK. They adapt very well to our climate. They make good pets and sometimes they're used for trekking. You go on a picnic and use a llama to carry your food. Cool! I want to do that! And sometimes farmers use them as guard dogs, I mean guard llama. The adult males will protect sheep and hens from animals that might attack them, like dogs or foxes. They're really useful animals.\n",
            "Come on then Stephen, get up - let's get going. Right, give me a minute. This is heavy. I hope you've remembered everything. You've got your walking boots, haven't you? Er yes, I'm wearing them. They're brand new and they're already starting to rub. We've come to Loch Ness in Scotland. We're going on a walking tour of the Highlands. It is such a beautiful place to explore. Thousands of people come here every year and try and take a photo of Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster. Fingers crossed Ashlie, let's hope we get lucky! Oh, come on Stephen you know that's only a story. We're here for the walking. Come on then, let's get going. Fancy a break, Stephen? Shall we take a look around the Visitors' Centre? Boring! I thought we were here to go walking. It won't take long. And, you never know, you might learn something. See Ash, I told you we'd find the Loch Ness Monster. Ha ha - mmm very first sighting seventh century lives in the loch. Possibly related to some species of reptileoh honestly. Wow, I bet it's true, look at all these photos. I really think we should try and find it. Come on Ash, it'll be fun. Oh Stephen, it's a waste of time. People made these photos. They're not real. That's ridiculous. Look at all these reports. It's got to be true. There isn't really a monster living in the Loch. You'll believe anything. If I saw a real photo of this monster, then I'd believe it. I bet if someone took a photo of the monster, they'd make loads of money. I really want to find the Monster, but first I need to find a shop that sells socks. My feet are killing me. OK then. Let's head into town and get you some socks. Oh wait a minute, Stephen. This looks interesting. I want to go in and take a proper look. That's just tourist stuff. I want to go and get those socks! I'll call you when I'm done. OK, I'll see you later. These are amazing. Excuse me, how many different tartans are there? At the last count, there were over three thousand tartans with new ones being designed every day. This one's nice. What's this one called? That's the Royal Stewart tartan belonging to the Stewart Clan. Every clan has its own tartan; the MacKenzies, the Frasers, the Gordons and many, many more. What about my surname, Walker? Walker, yes, it's a very popular Scottish name. We've got it in mugs, ribbons and even a kilt. No way - a Walker tartan kilt! We've also got it in a book here where you can learn about your clan history. Maybe I should get my brother a kilt. No, on second thoughts, he'd probably kill me! I'll just take the book, thanks. Hiya Stephen, I'm all done here. Did you manage to buy some new socks? Sort of. I'll come back to the shop. I'll see you in a second. OK. that's two pounds fifty, please Great - thank you. There's five. Thank you, and two pounds fifty change, thank you. Thank you very much. Stephen! What do you reckon? It suits you!\n",
            "Look at this, Stephen. It says here that this castle was built in the Sixth Century. Stephen, can you imagine what life must have been like to live here in those days? Ashlie, I need to concentrate. I don't want to miss the monster. We're here on the banks of Loch Ness and this is Urquhart Castle. It's a wonderful place with some amazing views. And a great place to look for the monster! Oh look, they do tours of the loch. Now that would be a better way to search for Nessie, and quite a nice way to spend an afternoon. Come on. Let's find out more about the boat tours. The boats must leave from over there. Come on, let's see if we can get some tickets. Wait a minute Ash! I want to take a few photos, the views from here are amazing. Okay but be quick. I don't want to miss the boat. Let me take one of you over there. Left a bit. Right a bit. Perfect. Ok, shall I take one of you? Yes, here you go. Ok. Back a bit. Back a bit. Back a bit more, lovely. Stephen! You idiot! Thanks a lot, Ashlie! Oh come on. We don't want to miss the boat. Excuse me. Is this the Loch Ness tour boat? Yes, have you got a ticket for me? Great! thank you very much. This is great. I wonder if we'll see the Loch Ness Monster. It's not real you know. Well actually, there have been a lot of sightings of a... a creature in this area. Believe it or not, it goes all the way back to the year 565. Saint Columba was travelling through this part of the highlands when he's said to have blessed the water here to rid the waters of a large creature that was plaguing the local folks. Although I would say that most of the modern day sightings, they started around the 1930's, when this road alongside Loch Ness was first built. I don't know. So do you think the Loch Ness Monster's real then? Well, there's certainly a lot of area for some creature to hide in because the Loch here is 38 Kilometres long from end to end, it averages about 230 metres deep. So there's plenty of area for a monster to hide. But if you can't see it by eye, perhaps you might just like to check out the sonar in the main saloon. Sonar? Yes! I'm going to go to the front of the boat for a better view. Oh wait a minute. Give me the camera and I'll take a proper photo of you. And try not to fall down this time, yeah? Stephen... Look at this. What's that?\n",
            "Thanks for coming, everyone. So, we're here today to define the timeline for our new project. Yes, Jani, that's a great idea. OK. What do you need from us? Hold on a moment. I think we need to decide between us what to do, to make sure it works for all departments. Yes, exactly, don't worry. We're going to discuss this and make a decision together. Let's first think about the scheduling of each project phase. What do you think, Emiko? Can I interrupt? I think we should first be clear about the process we'll use to make the decision. How are we going to do it? Ah, yes. Good point. Well, I think the best way is for each of you to give your opinion and then we can discuss and make a decision. OK. That sounds good. Yes, that works for me too. I know we're still planning the structure of the later phases of the project, but I think we should begin phase one as soon as possible. We can work out the rest later, as we go along. I'm sorry, I don't think so. How can we start phase one if we're not fully clear on where the rest of the project will take us? We might make a wrong decision and waste time. I agree with you on that point, David. However, we'll waste too much time if we wait until everything is planned before we actually start working on the project. I think we should take an agile approach. Agile approach? Well, it means that we start quickly and then adapt as we go along. That's right. Carolina, you've been very quiet. Um I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. I'm listening and thinking. Do you agree we should get the plan right first, and then start with phase one? I'm sorry, David. I don't think I agree with you. It's important to have a good plan. But plans can change, even the good ones - and business changes often. We need to be flexible, and we also need to move quickly. OK. So should we take a vote? Well, you're the project leader. Let's go with your decision. Yes, I'll follow your lead, Jani. Well, I guess that's decided then. We'll follow your agile approach, Jani. Start quickly and keep planning the later stages of the project. Yes, that's right. I still don't think this is the right decision, but I'm happy to go with the majority. We should add some space into the schedule later for additional work this 'flexibility' will need. Don't worry, David, we will. OK, so it's decided then. We'll start phase one as soon as possible, and in the background we'll continue planning the later phases and adapt them as we go along.\n",
            "Hello, Lluís. Hello. Erm, would you like to tell us about, erm, marathon running? 'Cause I know that you've started running marathons recently. Could you tell us a little bit about that, please? Er, well, yes, I started to, to, to run, like, er, I think, like, fourteen or fifteen years ago when I quit smoking. At the beginning I should run like a kilometre or two. And little by little because I didn't have any ambition of this, to run much, it was just to do a bit of exercise to help my quitting of smoking. Er, so, but little by little I start to like it. And then, you know, I start to run a little bit more time, do more kilometres. And the thing that, the big change became when I got a watch, this kind of watches that, er, measures the distance and the speed. After that, you know, you try to get better, to do more kilometres, to do, er, yah, more time, and so on. Until, you know, er, I reach, er, a form that allow me to do a half-marathon. Y'know, this was my first race, was a half-marathon and I saw that I could do a half-marathon. And then, you know, little by little I thought why not try a marathon! And that was two years ago, that I did my first marathon. It was from Girona to the Costa Brava. Ahh. And have you done any more marathons since the first one? Oh yeah. Last This year, I did the Barcelona Marathon, which would went at the beginning quite well 'cause I beat my best time for half-marathon which was like an hour and forty minutes and I did in the Barcelona Marathon an hour and thirty-one minutes which is quite good for men of my age and, you know, I'm not a professional or anything like that, so, quite a good time for me, I think. But then, at, at the end, you know, it was a very hot day. Maybe I didn't drank enough or something. At the kilometre forty, when it was only two kilometres left, I felt dizzy and you know, so I found myself on the ground and just my legs were weak and, you know, it felt numb and, you know, they had to, to help me out and sit me on a chair and they brought me some water and some food and, you know. So, at the end of the time it wasn't so good. But you did finish the marathon? Yes, I did. I did finish the marathon but not with the time that I wanted to do, which was three hours and fifteen. So, it was three hours and thirty-five minutes which is not that twenty minutes more than I wanted to do. But it was, still, it was still all right. OK, well, congratulations. Thanks for telling us about it.\n",

At least fifteen years. Wow. Yeah. Wow. So, what are you doing here? Sorry, you go first. OK. What are you doing here? I thought you'd moved to London. I was in London for a couple of years. But it didn't work out. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you... OK? I'm fine! The dream job wasn't really a dream, you know? Um... and London is great but it's so expensive. I mean, just the rent on a flat is... uh crazy expensive. I see. So, I came back. I've been back now for almost five months. Living back home with Mum and Dad. Which is err... interesting. Um... but anyway, what about you? Me? Oh, nothing new. You know me - 'Patrick the predictable'. I never left here. Oh. And is that...? Oh, I'm very happy. I'm married now.

That would be great. Let's swap numbers and...\n",
            "This is Southall Broadway in West London. This area has one of the largest Asian populations in London. The United Kingdom is an ethnically diverse country with many different communities that reflects the multicultural nature of Britain. Many British people's families originally come from overseas. Over the centuries, people from around the world have come to live here. The first significant wave of immigrants arrived by ship from Jamaica in 1948. The Notting Hill Carnival celebrates this Caribbean culture. In the 1950s and 60s, Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani families made Britain their home. Asian Ugandan refugees fled here in the 1970s. Followed by Somalis in the 90s. And in recent years, Eastern European citizens have arrived in search of work. This cultural variety makes Britain a vibrant place to be, but it's not without its problems. Conflicts can arise between cultures and generations. Young people whose parents or grandparents settled here have a very different experience of growing up to their parents. Sunny Grewel and his father Avinda live in Southall. Avinda came here from Kenya in the 70's. Sunny was born here. Avinda, what was life like when you first came here? It was hard. There was no jobs for, for people like us. And what's life like now, for young people, Sunny? I think we're very much a part of the communities and government and everything, so it's a lot more equal for everyone. What are the main arguments between the younger and older generations? When they were small, I wouldn't let him wear these earrings and have a long ponytail. They have to look smart. And what's the best thing about living here, Sunny? The food, the different cultures that come in and bring their spices, their experiences and even their rituals, so you get a taste of the world within this small community. In the past, differences between communities have led to violence. But new community-based projects have brought different generations and cultures together. Here at St Mary's School in Cardiff in Wales, more than 20 languages are spoken. It's one of the most multicultural schools in Wales. The school was involved with a project called 'Open Cities'. It helps migrants, people from other countries, become part of the community. The school children took pictures of people and places to show what it's like to live in Cardiff. Some of the kids are featured in an exhibition called Open Cities Faces. Mercy and Joy and their father Derek are originally from Zambia. They have lived here for six years. Derek, tell me why you came to Cardiff and why you took part in this project. I am an Engineering Consultant. I came to Cardiff because I was offered a job here. This project was a good thing because it was trying to show something positive about migration and integration. Why is Mercy photographed by a window? Because the photographer wanted to find a way to show the hopes for our future - the better life that we look towards. But there's a lot of shadow in that photograph, as well. Yes, the shadow is deliberate to try to show our past, where we've come from. And do you consider Cardiff to be your home now? Yes. We are part of the local community, we have settled down and we think Cardiff is great. Projects like 'Open Cities' can bring people in the community together and give young people hope for the future.\n",
            "Er, Ashlie, what are you doing? Looking for clues of course. But we haven't started yet. We've come away for a Murder Mystery Weekend. It's a fun game. We're going to be detectives and we're going to try and solve a pretend murder. I know it's only a game, but I'm going to be the first to solve the murder mystery. Like my hero, the world's most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. I'm going to solve the mystery in record time and find out who the killer is. Well, before we do that I think we should go and register, you know, meet the other people that are playing. I can't wait to get started. Look! Stephen! What's that? It's a clue. Er, Ashlie, I don't think so. That is not a clue. The game hasn't started yet. Come on, let's go and find Pete. Hi, Pete. Hi. So, how does this game work? I've never done anything like this before. Well, it's really easy. Someone will be chosen as the murderer - the organisers will decide. Then there will be a murder and the first victim will be found. So you'll get the chance to try to figure out who did it. OK - by following the clues? Yes, that's right. But don't forget, as the game continues there will be more murders and fewer and fewer guests. Really? And you must be Stephen Walker. Yes. This way, please. Hi, Pete. Hi, Ash. So, er, what have you found out so far? Found any clues? Er - the game hasn't started yet, Ash. I'm just having a cup of tea. Look! Out there. A body. There's been a murder! Aha! The game is afoot! Come on everybody, follow me! So, just as I suspected. Someone must have poisoned the tea. Ashlie, I don't think it was the tea that killed her. There's a gun on the floor. Maybe someone shot her? Well, yes. Just as I was about to say, Stephen. The murderer wanted us to think the tea was poisoned but in fact the murder weapon was that gun. Or maybe the poison was in that gun? Look! A muddy footprint. Maybe that's a clue. Aha, this must be a clue. It's wet. It could be tea. Some sugar, some tea and now a teaspoon. Interesting. We could be looking for a tea drinker. To the house! OK, Stephen, so let's start at the beginning. The first clue was Look! Another murder. I'm not sure, Ashlie. He's still warm. The murderer might be close. He could have just left. Ashlie, Stephen and man: Arghh! What are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd been murdered. What? We're looking for clues. We're looking for a murderer. Well, really! Sorry. I can't believe you did that, Ashlie. Well, he did look dead. Look! Another clue!\n",
            "Look, Stephen! Another murder. We need to find the killer before he strikes again. Ashlie thinks she's Sherlock Holmes. She's taking this murder mystery game very seriously. Stephen. You're meant to be my trusty assistant Watson. OK, Sherlock. What have you found? Well, he seems to be pointing under that sofa. Oh, really? Let me see. Well, is anything there? Ah! A clue! A button And that's a clue? Well, Stephen, maybe not for your average detective. But for someone with my powers... Your powers? Yes. Like Sherlock Holmes once said, 'Once you have eliminated the impossible, only the possible remains.' Or something like that. Come on, Watson. This mystery is almost solved. Bring all the guests into the library. I have an important announcement to make. OK, come on then. Er, not you Pete. You're dead, remember? Oh, right. Sorry! Right. The detective is about to name the murderer. So, my first clue was the teacup. It was clear that the murderer had poisoned their first victim. Ashlie, I thought we had already decided the first victim was shot. So you may think. My second clue, though, was the small patch of tea on the victim's jacket. Now, as Sherlock Holmes once said, once you have removed the impossible, only the possible remains. The murderer would obviously know each and every one of you by heart. In conclusion, I was led to the murderer by the clues he had left. And the murderer... is you, sir. Er, sorry? You, sir. You are the murderer. Actually, I'm not part of this game. I was just bringing some biscuits. Poisoned biscuits. I knew it. Really, I just work here. Is this not your button? Ashlie, if you'd been concentrating, the murderer was obvious right from the start. You found the gun I'd placed near the woman. You didn't find the candlestick. You didn't find the bottle of poison. And you didn't find the knife I had left under the sofa. So you see, Ashlie, it was me all along. What, you? Aha, so you confess your crimes? Yes, Ashlie. And, of course, that was my plan. I knew you were the murderer. That's why I blamed the waiter. I wanted you to admit that you were the murderer. Of course you did. Come on, Sherlock. It's time for a cup of tea.\n",
            "That was amazing! I can't believe they played my favourite song. The one that goes 'duh, nuh nuh nuh'? That one's my favourite too. Duh, nuh nuh nuh Yeah, something like that, Stephen. We've just been to see one of our favourite bands playing live. That was awesome. Live music is so much better than listening to it through headphones. Yeah, I know all their songs. It was great singing along with the lyrics. Talking of singing, how's your band going? Have you got a name yet? We can't make up our minds. We were thinking about The Mysteries. The Mysteries. Hmm, I'm not sure it's very catchy. It's not fair that you're in a band. I want to be in a band too. I'd be great. Well, I don't really think you'd fit in to our band. Anyway, you can't play any musical instruments. How hard can it be? I'm a really fast learner. I could learn to play the drums in no time. And you know what a great singer I am. Well, we're meeting at the studio to rehearse tomorrow. Oh, let me come along. Please, Ash! OK, I suppose you can come and watch. Yes! Duh, nuh nuh nuh Ah, girls, that was great! But Teri, I think we were a bit out of time in the middle. Yeah, that's a really difficult bit. Shall we try that again? But first let's decide on our name. Shall we definitely be called the Miss-Teries? Sort of Mysteries and Miss Teries? I really like that. I like it, yeah. OK, Miss-Teries it is! Let's try that again then, shall we? A one, a two, a one, two, three, four Hi, Ash. Hi, guys! Hi, Stephen. So this is the band, right? Yeah we're the Miss-Teries. Sorry, this is my brother Stephen. This is Teri, and this is also Teri. Do you mind if he watches for a bit? Sure, I don't mind. OK. Just don't make too much noise. We've got a gig on Saturday and we really need to rehearse. That's OK. I'll just sit in there and keep quiet. A one, a two, a one, two, three, four You're doing really well. That sounds amazing, guys. I'm going to record the next one. OK, girls. From the top. A one, two - a one, two, three, four Stephen! What are you doing? You're supposed to be watching. Oh, sorry. I'm just trying to help out. Can't I have a go? Oh, let him have a play. What about singing? Let's try him out as a backing singer? All right then. There's the microphone and there are the words. Right, let's try that from the beginning. A one, two - a one, two, three, four Er, maybe you could just try the 'oohs' and the 'aahs'? OK, again. A one, two - a one, two, three, four OK, OK, I think we've heard enough! What do you think? Talent or what? I can't take any more. The thing is, Stephen, this band really isn't for you. You see, we're called the Miss-Teries. We're a girl band. Oh, please, Ash! I'll do anything. Can't I play one of the other instruments? I suppose there is one instrument you can play. Go on then. OK, guys. We're ready to record now.\n",
            "I am so excited about our first gig tonight. Thanks so much for helping with all the instruments. Oh, that's OK. Where do you want this guitar? Just put it over there. The others should be here soon. Look, it's a poster for our gig tonight! Oh yeah, The Miss-Teries. I hope it goes well, I'm really sorry I can't stay to watch. You aren't still mad at me, are you? For not being in the band? Of course not! I've got my own gig tonight. Have you joined another band? Well, not exactly. I've got my own plans. I'm playing in Covent Garden later. Wow! I'm really impressed. I told you I'm a fast learner! Well, I am terrified. This will be our first time playing live. We've been practising really hard, but what if it all goes wrong on stage? I'm sure you'll be great. And look, here come the rest of the girls. Oh hi, girls! So are you ready for this? Yes, it's going to be great. Look, we'd better get ready. We'll be starting soon. Yes, definitely. I've got to go, too. Why don't you come and watch me play later? Yeah, sure. We'd love to. All right. Goodbye and good luck! Thanks. See you later. Come on, girls. OK, girls. Let's go and find our dressing room before the fans arrive. I hope they've remembered our flowers and champagne. Ash, don't be silly! We're not pop stars yet. Er, excuse me. Hi, I'm Ashlie from the Miss-Teries. Can you show us where our dressing room is, please? The who? The Miss-Teries, we're a band. We're playing here tonight. Are you? Well that's a mystery to me! Nobody tells me anything. I was just told to clear up. This place is a mess. I bet real pop stars don't have to deal with this. Come on. Let's go this way. Excuse me. Ah. You can hear me. Oh. I can't believe I'm talking to a statue. I'm Stephen Walker and I'm playing here. Do you know where I need to go? Of course. Any idea where my place is? Thank you. Next time we're going to get a proper dressing room - with flowers! Come on, girls. This is our big moment. Are we ready for this? I think so. Yeah! Yeah! OK! Let's do it. Come on then, girlies. Let's do this for the Miss-Teries! Right, let's go! Ready? Good evening, London! We're the Miss-Teries! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And for my next song I will Hi, Stephen! Oh hi, Ashlie! How did your gig go? Well, not as good as yours! Ah, here. Take this. Come and join in! Thanks! This is better than the big time!\n",
            "I really like The Notebook; it's a romantic classic. The story is about a poor boy, called Noah, who meets a rich girl, called Allie, and they fall in love over one summer. But of course there are problems. Allie's parents don't approve of Noah because he's poor and they get separated, then a lot of time passes before they can get together again. She goes away to college and he writes to her every day, but she doesn't get the letters. Then after quite a long time, Noah buys an old house which he promised to restore for Allie. He does it up and she sees a newspaper article about it and goes to find him again. You can probably guess the rest, but it's a bit complicated because she is engaged to another man. Noah is played by Ryan Gosling, who's my favourite actor, and he stops the film being too soppy - but you still cry a lot at the end. Rachel McAdams is really good too, as Allie. I think my favourite film is Skyfall, the last James Bond movie. It stars Daniel Craig again and Javier Bardem is this really evil baddie. They're both great, and so is Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss. It's a bit different to other Bond films. The story is more important, although there is still a lot of action. It's really well filmed, especially in the scenes which are shot in Shanghai and Scotland, and it's really exciting, of course. Bond is also a bit different - although he does amazing things, he seems older and that makes him more human and the story more realistic. Oh, the song by Adele is great, too. You know it won an Oscar? It's not a very recent film, but I love Pride and Prejudice - the version with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy. The story is really clever and interesting, besides being romantic. It's all about how we tend to jump to conclusions about people and we're often completely wrong. Elizabeth thinks Mr Darcy is stuck up and snobbish at the beginning of the film, but at the end she realises she has been completely wrong and he isn't like that at all. She also realises he has an enormous house and that maybe helps her fall in love with him too! After I saw the film I read the book by Jane Austen and I really recommend that too. Although it was published 200 years ago, it's still a great read and really funny in parts. My favourite film has to be The Matrix. Even though it was made back in 1999, it still feels really modern. It's about this ordinary man, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, who works with computers during the day and is a hacker at night. One day he is contacted by a woman who introduces him to a very strange man: Morpheus. Morpheus explains to Neo that what he thinks of as real is actually fiction and the world is run by evil machines who have imprisoned and tricked the human race. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as Morpheus, and Keanu Reeves is excellent, but the best thing about the film is the special effects. I can watch it again and again. Let the Right One In is my favourite film. There are two versions, the first is Swedish and the second American - I prefer the original, Swedish version. It's a modern vampire film and also a kind of love story, but it's really unsentimental and a bit scary in places. Oskar is a young boy with a lot of problems. He is being bullied at school and wants revenge on the bullies. Then some new neighbours move in next door and he becomes friends with Eli, a beautiful but strange girl. I won't tell you any more, because it will spoil the story, but expect a serial killer, a lot of violence and blood-drinking. If you like that kind of thing, you'll love this.\n",
            "I want to talk about my son. My son is now one year and eight months old, has brought enormous happiness to our family, although my wife, my parent-in-law always complain about how tiring it is to look after him. He is really cute and adorable. He can now speak some very simple words, such as 'papa', 'mama', but he can understand quite a lot of things, although he can't, cannot express himself verbally. For example, he can recognise the personal belongings of each family members, such as my T-shirt, the eyeglasses of grandpa or my wife's bag, etc. He also firmly protects his own personal belongings, such as his little chair, on which he sits for meals. He will drive you away if you attempt to sit on his chair. I am always amazed how fast he can learn things and how good his memories is. He can instantly learn something funny gestures on TV programmes. For example, we found out that as he walked, he kicked his legs and feet high, and then we recalled it was because he watched the national parade in Tiananmen Square on the National Day. And he also learned some gestures like kung fu after watching the gymnastics in sports programmes. I always believe that parents are the first and best teachers for children. I have a lot of friends who are also new parent. They bought, they pay for their kids' very expensive course - some pre-school course. I believe that you need to nurture and brought up your children with your heart and love, so every weekend, my wife and I will take him to parks because I live very close to the zoo, the Guangzhou Zoo, so I often take him to the zoo and show him the animals. He always loves that - watching all kinds of animals. I also want to do some experiments. I want to see how children learn language so I try to teach him bilingually, so I teach him to say some words in English and then in Mandarin. And now he can understand quite a lot of instructions. For example, if I ask him 'Where is your bike?' and he'll run to his bike and show his bike. And if I ask him, 'Where is the moon?' and then he will point his finger up into the sky, so I think he is quite funny. And I also hope that if he can learn English at a very young age, then he will not suffer too much when he studies at school. I think a child can bring enormous happiness to the family and to my life. I now always feel joy and peaceful while I am with him, so my favourite time-killing is to play with him after meal, after work so I always can forget all about the frustrations and sometimes unhappiness in work and feel fully recharged. I have now learned strong family values after bringing up my son and I understand how difficult it is to be parent. So I now try to call my parents whenever I have time, take them out to dinner or try to visit them during the weekends. So I think it's great to be parent.\n",
            "That should do it. The Yorkshire Grey in half an hour... I'm here in Covent Garden and we're going on a night out. It's the very centre of London - a place where lots of people come to meet up and hit the town. Now, Stephen should be here any minute. Hi Ash. Sorry I'm late. Have you heard from Caroline and Carl? Yes, they're at the Yorkshire Grey. Just round the corner. Come on. You alright? How are you? Hi Carline - how've you been? Yeah good - so great to see you. How are you? How's things? Really good. You? Yeah - good thanks. Go on then Stephen - get us some drinks. Ok - what will you have? I'll have a sparkling water and what are you having, Caroline? Er, a glass of white wine. And a glass of white for Caroline. Ooh and get us some crisps, salt and vinegar. And how about you Carl? What can I get you? Thanks Stephen, I'll have a pint of lager. Come on then. Let's go and sit down. I'll give you a hand. Hi there. Can I have a sparkling Sorry - Hi Phil? This really isn't a good time. I'll call you back in er...10 minutes? OK. Yeah. Right. Um, can I have a sparkling water, a glass of white wine, a coke, a pint of lager - and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps, please? There's the lager, a sparkling water, a cola and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps.... Is there anything else? That's it thanks. That's nine ninety, please. Here you go, 10 pounds. Keep the change. Here they are. You guys took your time. Big queue at the bar. There you go. Thank you. So, what's the plan for tonight then? Well, we could go to another pub? Or we could Phil called. I said I'd call him back. Ah - I'll give him a ring. His band might be playing tonight. I'll just pop outside. I'll be back in a sec. What sort of music is it? Do you know what it's a bit it's not my kind of thing Right guys. Listen. Phil's band are playing tonight in Brixton and if we leave now we'll make it just in time. OK then, lets go. Come on then, let's get a taxi. Wow, they're so cool! Hmmm. Thank you very much. We're the Rum Shebeens. Goodnight. They were excellent. They were so good! Ah - I'm not sure about the music. It's not exactly my kind of thing. You can't really dance to it, can you? You know what guys, I think we should go dancing. I know a great place. Actually, it's getting quite late. Oh, come on. Sorry, I've got to go to work in the morning. Me too, Stephen. I'm sorry. We'll get a taxi home. OK, never mind. It looks like it's just me and you, kid! Well, actually Stephen, it is late and... Oh come on, don't be so boring. I want to dance. Oh, alright, then. See you later guys! Have a good night. See you later! See you! Bye. Have a good night - take care! Right then. Where are you taking me? You're going to love it.\n",
            "This was Stephen's idea. He loves clubbing, but this really isn't my kind of music! I don't know why I put up with him sometimes. What's wrong, Ash? Surely you must like this. It's great! I'm just getting warmed up! Oh Stephen I can hardly hear you. What did you say? I said the music's great. Why aren't you dancing? You must be joking, it sounds like a car alarm. It's giving me a headache. I can't stand this kind of music. Oh, but dance music's much better... You know I'm going to speak to the DJ. Ashlie! What are you doing? You've cleared the dance floor. This is a dance club, not some pop venue. Well, I couldn't listen to that noise anymore. Come on. Let's get out of here before people start complaining! Listen - we've tried live music, a club and a pub and I've just had a message from Sally and she says there's a party at her friend's house. Come on, let's get a taxi. You don't have to get up early tomorrow, do you? No, but we won't know anyone there. Are you sure we can just turn up? Are they going to let us in? Yes - I'm sure - we'll just tell them you're with me. Come on, I've got to look up her address. Hey guys, all right... This is such a great house for a party. Yes, it is, isn't it? Except someone's just turned up that terrible music. We haven't been very lucky tonight, have we? For once I agree with you. I thought coming to a house party would be better than a club. You know, we could chat, meet some really cool people but this is awful. Right - that's it. We've spent the whole night complaining about music. Come on, we're off! I can't believe it. We were looking for the perfect night out and look where we ended up. Oh, I've got an idea. Why don't we make our own music! Oi! Keep the noise down!\n",
            "Wow, these are amazing. This one's really nice. You'd look great in that. No, I think I'd prefer something like this. This is much more colourful. We're here in East London planning our costumes for next week's Notting Hill Carnival. There's lots of work to do before the big day. Yeah, here at the Mas-Camp, they're busy making all of their own costumes. And today, I'm here to help. So while I'm busy with that, Stephen's going to be picking up some dance moves. Yeah, come on. Wow, this looks really complicated - what's it going to be? It's called 'Pollination' and it's going to be a butterfly on a flower. Oh, it's beautiful. But it must take you hours and hours to work on this. Actually, we started about three months ago. So yes, hours and hours. So do you all compete, then, to see who's got the best costume? Yes, actually we have the competition in about four days at Alexander Palace. Wow, you must be nervous. Yeah, really. Good luck for this year - I'm sure you'll do brilliantly. Thank you very much. Stephen, can you just help me with this? Yes, what do you need me to do? Can you hold this piece down while I glue this on? Yeah. What is it? This is going to be part of my head-piece. Wow! That's going to look absolutely amazing. Shall I put my finger here? Yes, right that's it. Thank you, I just need to glue this piece down. There we go. Right, shouldn't you be learning some dance moves? Stephen! You're glued to my hat! Excuse me, mate. Is this the dance lesson? Yes, I'm the dance teacher. Do you want to join in? Yes, please! Alright, come on, let me show you what to do. Alright, so, let's see what we're going to do. We're going to do a criss-cross to the right and kick with our left foot at the same time. I'll do it with you, go on. Criss-cross, kick, kick. OK, I can do that. Ready? Yep. Sure? OK, lets go, listen to this, 5,6,7,8... Wow! The costume looks great. What do you think of mine? Er, well it's nice, but mine is better. I mean it's more, more glamorous. And do you know what? I helped make it myself! So how did the dancing lesson go? It was excellent! I had a really good teacher - really hard work though - I'm exhausted already. Come on then - show me your moves! Yeah, I think you're going to need a little more practice. Ha - maybe. C'mon you need to practise some moves too, if we're going to win a prize for the best carnival dancers. I can't wait. I'm really excited. It's going to be fab! Come on then.\n",
            "Come on, this way. We need to get to the start of the parade before they set off. OK! OK! We've got plenty of time though. I want to have a look around. It all looks great. We're here at the Notting Hill Carnival; one of Europe's most famous street parties. Where every year thousands of people come to take part in the parade and wear fabulous costumes. And it's also a chance to watch some amazing shows and see some pretty strange sights... I know I'm really looking forward to it. Me, too. Come on then. Let's see what's out there. Ah - I love it, Ash. And there's such a good atmosphere, isn't there. Oh, come on though - we haven't got all day. Oh, wait a minute, I want to look up there. Oh Stephen, I really don't want to miss the start of the parade. We haven't got time. Oh, it'll only take a minute. I'll catch you up. You know where it is? By the car park. Yeah yeah, go on ahead, I'll catch you up in a minute. See you later. Hi girls. Hiya. So have you done this before? No, this is my first year actually. Wow. Yeah, I done it yesterday though, for the children's carnival. What was it like? It rained for a bit, but other than that, it was really fun. Yeah? Oh, it's beautiful weather today. So how long will we be dancing for? Sometimes we can be dancing for like, two or three hours - we, like walk around, but sometimes you can stand in one place for, like ten minutes and be dancing to, like the same kind of music. It's really difficult. Yeah, we're going to need some energy for that. That's right. Stephen! Where have you been? It took me ages to find you. All of you dancers look the same in those costumes. Ah, phew, just in time; the parade's about to start. You go to the front - I'm going to meet the rest of the group, OK? See you later. Oh, hang on, where are we going to meet afterwards in case we get split up? Well, I'll ring you when we finish. Oh, Stephen I haven't got my phone. Me, neither. Where do we finish? Erm next to the tube station, I'll meet you there. Oh and don't get lost again! OK, sounds good. See you later! Bye. Wow, that was fantastic. Did you see me dancing? Yes, I saw you. It was amazing, but I didn't expect to be so tired. We must have been dancing for hours. Now, we need to sit down and get something to eat. Good idea. So what do you suggest? Something over there? Right, come on you, it's time for home. Stephen - how are we going to get home? All the buses are going to be full and I am not taking the underground wearing this costume. Err... taxi? Stephen. Can you see any taxis? All the roads are closed for the carnival. C'mon, let's start walking! Walking? No way! Why walk when you can dance?\n",
            "On 'Star Students' today we're speaking to Peter, who is going to tell us about the Pomodoro Technique, a system to help manage your time. It was invented by an Italian man called Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Now, he called it the Pomodoro Technique after a tomato-shaped timer that his mother used to use when she was cooking. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. And this tomato has helped Peter become an A-grade student. So, Peter, welcome to the studio. Thanks. Tell us about the Pomodoro Technique. What's it about? It's about getting maximum productivity from your available time. I use it for studying, but professionals use it at work. Is it difficult to follow? No. It's actually very simple. It's about breaking down your work into separate jobs and then using a timer to separate your time into periods of intensive work and short breaks. OK, well, that sounds sensible. So, how do you start? First of all, you should think about the task you need to complete. For example, writing an essay for homework. You need to think about all the stages of the task and write a clear to-do list on a piece of paper. When you are ready to start you set the timer to 25 minutes and you start working on the first item on the list. OK but what happens when the timer goes off? When the timer goes off you must take a short break of between 3 to 5 minutes. One 25-minute session is one 'pomodoro' so when you have completed this, you deserve a short break. You should try to move about a bit during the break. Then, set the timer for another 25 minutes and keep working. At the end of the next 'pomodoro' you have another short break. As you complete the items on the 'to-do' list you should tick them off, to give you a feeling of satisfaction that you're getting the job done. OK I get it. Can you use any timer? Most people have timers on their phones these days. Could you use that? You could, but the danger is that then you can check messages on your phone or you start looking at apps. I use my dad's kitchen timer and I make sure I switch off my phone when I'm studying. I get so much more done. In the breaks I sometimes check my phone but only if I've completed some of the items on my to-do list. Three to five minutes isn't long for a break. Is that enough time? Well, when you've had four or five short breaks you can take a longer break, and then you start again. And it works? Yes, it works for me! It stops me wasting time. My work is much more effective when I use the timer. It's like short, intense periods of work. I actually get my homework done a lot quicker now, which leaves me more free time, so for me it works really well. Oh, I think I'll give it a try. Thanks so much for coming in, Peter. You're welcome. Thanks for inviting me.\n",
            "Ice on the road, bridge ahead, look out for wild animals. What's this one, Ash? That one means 'danger, river bank' or something. It's obvious, look at it. I'm studying for my driving test. You have to do a test in the car when you're learning to drive and you have to do a written test as well - so I have to learn all these signs. And I'm studying for my Business Studies course. I have to go to Oxford this afternoon to do an exam so I'm doing some last minute revision. Hey, Ash. What? Did you say your exam's in Oxford? Yeah, so? So, why don't I drive us there? And you can give me a driving lesson on the way. I really need the practice. OK, then. Sounds good. Great! When do we need to go? Well, with you driving? Now! I'll go and get a map. Oh, you don't need to - we've got the GPS. Excellent, shall we go? Yep. OK. Ready to go! Seatbelt on. Oops. Seatbelt on. Right. Look in the mirrors. Get into gear. Signal. Just check the mirrors again. And off we go. This is easy! You're doing OK, just take it easy, the GPS knows where we're going. Turn right in 100 metres. Turn right in 100 metres. Continue driving around the roundabout for five kilometres. Turn left in 200 metres. Left?! That can't be right. We're going round in circles. I think we should go right. Keep left. Approaching destination in 5 metres. Stephen! Let's turn that thing off and turn around. Oh, come on. I'm going to be late. It's almost two o'clock now. Which way do I go Ash? Oh, look, just stop here. Over there. OK - remember to lock the car and don't forget to take the GPS with you. I'll give you a ring after my exam. Bye! Taxi! Excuse me, can you take me to Oriel College, please? OK. Thanks. You have arrived at your destination.\n",
            "While Ashlie's in her exam, I'm going to have a look around Oxford. You probably know it's famous for its university, but let's find out a little bit more. ..... Hello. Hello. Er, I'm visiting Oxford for the day, what's the best thing to do? Well it's a lovely day. I suggest you walk around the colleges, take a bus tour, explore the Bodleian Library or take a punt on the river with a picnic. How many colleges are there? There's around 39. What's the best way to see Oxford? The best way to see Oxford is probably on foot with one of our green and blue badge guides. Great. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Hiya girls. You alright? Good, thank you. Are you students here? Yes What are you studying? History. Yeah History, too. What's it like being a student here? It's great. Really good. It's, like, the best university known worldwide so it's a great place to be. So tell me what it's like studying here in Oxford. We have lectures and seminars and then it's your own time to go to the library and read your books and do your research for the next lecture so if you don't do that reading, then you're not prepared for the next lecture - so it's really up to you to do your own work. And what's the social life like here? Loads of stuff, like, really good pubs, really good clubs erm, like, when it's sunny and stuff it's beautiful to just sit in the sun and, like, go punting and stuff. So it's really nice. Right, I've got a great idea for what to do with Ashlie when she finishes her exam. So? How did it go? Really well, I think. I answered all the questions and I finished in time, so fingers crossed. Great. Listen, you deserve a treat after all your hard work. I've somewhere I want to take you. Alright then, I'll see you in a second. OK. Bye. Wow, it's really nice down here. I know. I've booked us a boat for a trip on the river. Really? Oh thank you. That's great. I've always wanted to try this. Come on. Can I have a go first? Watch out. Here I go Ready? Yup. Off we go! This is great. Which way shall we go, Ash? Let's ask the GPS. OK, my turn. Stephen, not like that - we're going round in circles! Stephen! Stephen - watch out for that. The GPS! Ashlie! What are we going to do now, without the GPS? Oh, it was useless anyway. It didn't help us get here. I'll have to go and buy a map. OK, you can read the map but give me the keys because I'm driving home. Stephen! Watch out!\n",
            "Oxford should be about an hour's drive from London. It's very popular with tourists and students. And Oxford University is one of the top ten universities in the world. I'm at the top of the Carfax Tower. It has amazing views over the city and from here you can see that the university really is at the heart of the city. Oxford University is made up of thirty eight different colleges. There are twenty thousand students studying at Oxford from nearly a hundred and fifty countries. Studying here can be an amazing experience. Some of these colleges are more than 700 years old. Many students get involved in activities outside their studies. The Oxford University Fencing Club is over a hundred years old. It is still popular today. How important are the extracurricular activities like the sporting clubs and societies? I think it's really important. I think especially in Oxford where it's a really strong academic environment it's really easy for people to just get really caught up and just live in the library. It's definitely good for people to get out and do something different. Is it difficult to get the balance right between your university work and your sport? Well, I tend to be busy all of the time. So I'm studying during the daytime and then in the evenings I come down here and train. You have to work really hard but at the same sense you can also, kind of, play really hard. You can train hard and do really well at sports and other activities. ..... There are universities in most big towns and cities in Britain. This is the LSE, the London School of Economics, part of the University of London. Many students come from abroad to study in the UK. They have to find tuition fees, food and somewhere to live. It can be expensive. Waqas Adenwala is from Pakistan and lives in Rosebury Hall, the university halls of residence about 2 kilometres from the main campus. Hi, Waqas. Hi Nick. Nice room. Thank you. So why do you live in a Halls of Residence? It's really nice. It's a short walk to the campus, it's cheap and I get to meet a lot more people. What's it like to live here? It's great. There's so many things I can do over here. There's a canteen, a bar, a TV room and then there's even a laundry. Will you live here next year? I will. In the first year everyone gets the accommodation, but they move out to share a flat next year, but I'm definitely staying here. Back on campus, students have social areas where they can relax. The Students' Union building is the place where they can meet friends after a busy day. Michael Lock is from Hong Kong and is studying law at the London School of Economics. He's also International Students' Officer. So what goes on here at the LSE Student's Union? Well, Nick, as you can see, students will come here between their classes and lectures and will meet up with their friends before going home or going to another class. And you're an International Students' Officer. What does that mean? About 70 percent of our students come from overseas, so I work with some of them in helping them in visa issues and generally settling down in a new home in London. And what tips would you give to any students thinking of coming to study in the UK? I think my number one tip is - get a nice jacket because it can get pretty cold - and secondly - know what you are looking for - because different universities are very different. And finally keep an open mind - do not be afraid to meet new people and have fun! Good advice. Your shot. Studying in Britain can cost a lot of money and students need to work hard but the main thing to remember about being a student is that it's also a lot of fun.\n",
            "Here in the UK people like this are saving lives every hour of every day. The Ambulance Service receives thousands of emergency calls. It is part of the National Health Service, which provides free health care, paid for out of taxation. When someone's reported a serious accident or emergency, ambulance crews get there as fast as they can. Their speed and medical education make the difference between life and death. I'm spending a day with paramedics in Brighton, on the south coast of England. These student medics are training at the University of Brighton. Most study for three years to pass the required exams. Their tutors watch and give feedback from a control room. These emergencies are made to look as realistic as possible, so don't worry - this accident is just pretend. Emily Skinner is one of the students. What sort of person makes a good paramedic? I think someone that can communicate well, who works well in a team, has leadership skills. What sort of emergencies do you prepare for? Well, we could go to a huge range of emergencies: asthma, chest pain, people who've had injuries, trauma like in road traffic collisions. After passing their exams, the students can work in an ambulance like this. It is packed with the latest technology to help save lives. Carl Walton is one of the paramedics in Brighton. Being a paramedic - is it the toughest job in the world? It can be very challenging, can be very challenging. You know, we're answering treble-nine calls, upwards of 8 to 12 a day, so that can be particularly stressful, very tiring, but trauma jobs are very challenging. There's a lot going on and you have to - it's a time-critical job. You've got to be on-scene for a very limited amount of time and get them to the trauma unit or hospital as fast as you can. It's hard work but very rewarding. Carl normally works on his own and can get to a patient first in the ambulance car. This is kind of a compact version of what you might expect an ambulance to be, so what have you got in it? This is, I would say, the most important thing that we carry. This is a heart start machine. We use this if someone's in cardiac arrest and we need to an electric shock to restart their heart. And it's nice and compact, it's very portable and very easy to use compared to the ones that are carried on a lot of the ambulances, which are quite cumbersome and heavy. While we were talking to Carl, an emergency call comes in. This is a real one, this is it. Yeah. Go, yeah. With blue lights on and sirens wailing, Carl gets to the incident as quickly as possible. Thanks, Carl. Good luck! Fortunately, this time no-one was seriously hurt. It was just one of the many calls that crews from this station respond to every day. For Carl, it's back to the station - until the next call out.\n",
            "Seaside towns like Blackpool and here in Southend are home to entertainments like sandcastle building, donkey rides, eating fish and chips and ice cream. These towns are famous for their piers. This pier is more than two kilometres long. It's the longest pleasure pier in the world. There's even a train to take you to the other end. A hundred years ago the pier was an important part of seaside entertainment. Visitors could walk out across the sea and feel like they were on a ship. It was a thrilling experience. It doesn't feel very scary now. These days the pier is still home to traditional shows like Punch and Judy, a puppet show about Mr. Punch and his adventures. Mr. Punch is often naughty. Martin Scott Price has been performing in Blackpool for thirty-five years. In my show, I do have a very frightening crocodile. Mr Punch is a very naughty boy at times. And then Judy comes along, she has the sausages for tea and unfortunately the crocodile comes along and steals them and he drops them on the floor, sometimes you know. And the children go to put them back and - my gosh - he nearly eats their fingers and they go running away. Aw, my favourite character sadly is not Mr Punch, it's the crocodile! Ha ha ha. I love children, especially to eat. Ha ha ha. Parents and children seem to like traditional entertainment. But not all visitors want to see a show or go to the beach. What about modern attractions? Amusement arcades like this one feature virtual entertainment. I like being on a dance mat because it's fun, and it's good exercise and I like dancing to the music. I like to come and play in the arcades because it's good fun. I like to try and beat my friends at the games. I like playing driving games because they're fun, fast and exciting. Young people seem to enjoy arcade games. But can playing on a computer actually make someone better at sport? Dr Matthew Taylor is a Sports Scientist at the University of Essex. His work looks at how playing on a computer can affect physical activity. Can playing these computer games increase real sports skills? Dr. Taylor: Research has shown this not to be the case. It's not going to improve your football skills or your tennis skills, for example. But it will improve your hand-eye coordination. Can playing a computer game improve other skills? Formula one racing drivers practice on computer simulators to learn different tracks and also surgeons may increase their surgical skills by playing computer games. So do they improve physical ability in any way? The more active video games will improve your physical fitness but it's no real substitute for the real thing. And also you must remember that you shouldn't play these games for too long. One hundred years on and the seaside is still a popular place for entertainment and enjoyment. In the past it was a simple walk on the pier - these days it's virtual games and amusement arcades. But you can't come to the seaside without trying a stick of rock.\n",
            "The streets of London are full of history. But not all the famous characters associated with this city were real. More than a hundred years ago when people travelled by horse and cart and the foggy streets were lit by gaslight, one famous detective was leading the fight against crime. It was Victorian London, the time of Sherlock Holmes. The fictional character of Sherlock Holmes has been popular ever since he was created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800s. Since then, Holmes has appeared in many films Mr Holmes? Hello. from black-and-white classics to Hollywood blockbusters and TV dramas. Even though Sherlock Holmes wasn't a real person, you can find evidence of him all over London. There is a statue of Sherlock Holmes near Baker Street. Just around the corner, you can find his famous address, 221B. Ah, look! More evidence of Sherlock Holmes, a pub named after him. Let's pop in. There are lots of Sherlock-related things inside the pub. The pub even has its own room which is supposed to look like Sherlock Holmes' study with his famous pipe and laboratory instruments for his forensic or scientific approach to solving crimes. You can just imagine Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Doctor Watson discussing how to solve crimes here. Well, whoever's behind all this thing must be out of his mind. On the contrary, my dear fellow. If my assumptions are correct, this little scheme has behind it the most brilliant and ruthless intellect the world has ever known. Roger Johnson is from the Sherlock Holmes Society of London. What makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting? He's a hero, but he's a flawed hero in a way. He doesn't have superpowers in the way that, say, Superman does or the Marvel Avengers. He's a real human being and you can feel with Sherlock Holmes as you can't do with Superman, 'Yeah, I could be like that'. Why is he still so popular? The main reason is that the original stories are so good. They're very well written and they're tremendous fun to read. The Metropolitan Police Heritage Museum shows the history of policing in London. Holmes was famous for his use of forensic or scientific techniques to solve crimes. His creator, Conan Doyle, visited police museums to gain inspiration for his stories. Alan Moss is a former policeman and historian. Do you think it was useful for Conan Doyle to visit places like this? He was really interested in real-life crimes, but actually making those crimes into a really good story. Police methods and crime-solving techniques have changed since the time of Sherlock Holmes. New technology means the scientific or forensic method is even more important. So there's evidence of Sherlock Holmes all across London. It looks like he's going to continue being a popular fictional character for many more years to come. I wonder what Sherlock would make of today's forensic work and policing techniques. I guess we'll never know.\n",
            "Right, I think we've got everything. Here, let me help you with that. No, it's OK, I've got it. We're here in the beautiful mountains of Snowdonia in North Wales. We're here for a short relaxing break. We're going to put our feet up and have a complete rest for a couple of days. That's right, isn't it Stephen? Speak for yourself, Ash. Snowdonia is a great place for outdoor activities. You can go climbing, cycling, walking... I can't wait to get out onto the mountains and get some fresh air. Come on Ash. Let's check in. Hi - Can I help you? Hi, yes. We have a reservation for two nights. OK, what's the name, please? Walker. Walker. Is that Stephen and Ashlie? Yes. Two rooms for two nights? Yes. Can I just get you to fill this in, please? Sure. Hey Ash, have you seen all these leaflets? There's loads of stuff to do here. I'm going to hire a bike and ride to the top of the mountain. Do you want to come? What, now? You're joking, aren't you? Yeah - take these, can I have my room key, please? Thank you. I'm going to go get changed. I'll meet you back here in twenty minutes. OK. OK, so I think I'll have the manicure, the pedicure... OK. Oh, and I'll have that Indian head massage, too. And can you just tell me, what's the hot stones massage? Well, we use volcanic rock. You know, stones from a volcano; we heat them up and then we massage them over your body. It's really relaxing. Yeah, that sounds nice. Maybe I'll have that, too. Oh, and I see you do treatments for men? Yeah, we do a lot of treatments for men. Stephen doesn't know what he's missing. Look at you! It's great, isn't it? I'm all set to go. What are you going to do while I'm racing to the top of the mountain? Well, I thought I might try this It looks really relaxing and much better than cycling to the top of some old mountain. Yeah, it looks like hard work. Go on you, get going. Have a good time - and call me later. Bye. Bye. This is just so relaxing. Hello. Hi, Ashlie. Hi, Stephen. How are you doing? I'm... exhausted. I can hardly speak. Me too. This is lovely. I'm so relaxed. Ah, this is really tough. I've got a long way to go but I'm going to make it to the top. OK, then - well you just take it easy. Yeah, alright. OK, see you later. OK, bye! Snowden Mountain Railway. I think he'll see me sooner than he thinks!\n",
            "Hi. Can I have a return ticket, please? Yes, of course you can. Brilliant. How much is that? Twenty-five pounds, please. Great. Thank you. Twenty-five. And when is the next train? Four o'clock. Four p.m. Thank you very much. Thank you. This is the Snowdon Mountain Railway. Now, this train goes all the way from here, up to the top of the mountain. It's a steam train so it is quite slow but I'm sure I'll get to the top before Stephen. Now, I must take some photos. Yeah - that looks good - nice one! OK then? Thank you. That's lovely. Are you the train driver? Yes, I drive these locomotives and I've done so for about 29 years now. So how long does it take to get to the top? Just under an hour. Under an hour? It must be pretty high then. How high is it? It's about 1000 metres and it is the highest mountain in England and Wales. And it gets very cold there as well, so if I were you, I'd wear something a little warmer! Don't worry, I've got a big coat. That's good. Thank you. You're welcome, bye. What an amazing train! Ashlie! What are you doing here? How did you get here? Oh, hiya Stephen. What an amazing place. You know, it's a shame about the view though. What an amazing place? How did you get here? Well, I got the train, of course. You know, it's much easier than cycling. You got the train!? You mean to say while I've been riding up the mountain all afternoon, you. Oh, and I also got a spa treatment. Look, aren't they lovely? You're unbelievable! You look exhausted, Stephen. Come on, shall we go and get a coffee or a sandwich or something? A sandwich? You're on the top of a mountain! It isn't some kind of High Street, you know. Follow me. Just what we needed; a café at the top of the mountain. OK, what are you having, Stephen? Hmm. I'll have a coffee and one of these, a cheese sandwich. I think I'll have the soup and I'll have a hot chocolate. Hi there. Can I take your order, please? Yes please, I'll have a soup and a hot chocolate and he'll have a cheese sandwich and a coffee, please. Can I get you anything else? Yes, I was just wondering - it must be fun working here on the mountain. But how do you get to work everyday - you don't cycle, do you? No, we don't. There's an early train, a special train for all the staff who need to come up every morning. And what happens when the weather gets really bad? Do you ever get stuck up here? We do, we do get stuck sometimes. If the weather turns really bad, there's accommodation for the staff to stay overnight. Sounds cosy! Very cosy indeed. I'll just get your order for you now. Great, thank you very much. See, you should have got the train. Right. Time to make a move. It should be easier going downhill. It's easy for me. I'm going to catch the last train home. In fact, I wonder what time the last train is Ashlie, is it a small red and green train? Like that one? Oh, no! Wait! Ah, Stephen I've missed the last train! Come on Ash, jump on. I'll give you a lift! You on? Not too fast!\n",
            "Wherever we are, thanks to devices like these, we can all feel connected. They've created a media revolution. Ah! Just been sent the address and a picture of the place we need to go. So come on! This must be it. Now, part of that media revolution is happening inside that house. Let's go and see how. There are lights, a camera, actors and a film crew. They're filming a comedy programme. Action! AAAAAH! Right, you then, over here! But what's unusual here is that this programme isn't being made for television. This series is only happening because of the social media revolution. All about the McKenzies was launched on YouTube. They kept the costs down by filming on cheaper, high-quality cameras and using a real house rather than an expensive studio. With the help of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter as well as its own website, it has built up a dedicated following. Ian! Angel! No, Angel, get out! Technically, I'm not in the room She's right, bro. Shut up, both of you. Action! Now, they are filming the third series. Not bad when you consider the writer, director and star, Samuell Benta, had never done anything like this before. So tell me about All about the McKenzies. All about the McKenzies, basically, is centred around a Black British Caribbean family living in London, following Samuell McKenzie, who is the main protagonist. How easy was it to get started? It was just me with an idea, and I told people what I was doing in a video on Facebook. I posted an advert out saying 'Hey, listen, this is what I want to do. Who's interested?' Oh, right, so it all started with the use of social media? Yeah, I mean by using social media, it can just multiply rapidly. You can just share something, other people can share your stuff, and then next thing you know, a thousand people know about your idea when originally you only put one post up. Traditional media like magazines, newspapers and television broadcasters are also turning more and more to online media. Vice started twenty years ago as a magazine but has become one of the leading youth media brands in the world through social media. Al Brown is Head of Video at their London office. We're in some ways classic publishers. You know, we write and we make films. What we do is that we constantly make sure that we're responding to audience feedback in terms of what we're making, so I think our audience feel very included in the content that we make and part of that conversation. Having content that people want to talk about and want to recommend is a big part of the way that our audience grows. Now, you had to go there, you had to go there Back at the filming for All about the McKenzies, the cast and crew told us how important social media is to their careers and to the programme. Make-up Artist: I get about 80% of my work through social networking sites. It's all word of mouth, and the internet is the best way to spread the word. You hear things through Facebook through, you know, various different contacts. Make-up Artist 2: I can put pictures of, like, my work, so that, you know, if they see something they like, it's positive feedback and they can get in contact with you. LAPC. Freeze! There are now thousands of new programmes available online and which couldn't have been distributed before the arrival of social media. With so much content out there, the choice for you is bigger than ever before. You just have to learn how to navigate through that extra choice to find what's best for you.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Ashlie Walker and today, as you can see, I'm going to be talking about sixties fashion. The sixties is one of the most recognisable What are you wearing, Ash? Stephen! You've ruined it. I'll just have to start again now. Are you filming this? I'm making a short video for my fashion blog. Or I was, until you came in and spoilt it. Why do you want a video? I thought your blog was just words and pictures. It is. That's why I want to give it something extra - a bit of action. Now can you go away and leave me alone? Well, sounds a bit strange to me but OK, carry on. I'm going to make a sandwich. Thank you! The sixties was one of the most recognisable styles in fashion history. We're talking about colourful designs Ashlie, is there any cheese? Stephen! You are really putting me off! Anyway, what was I saying, oh yes the sixties is one of the most vibrant design Sorry, Ash. Is there any cheese? I'm trying to make an interesting video and you keep wandering around in the background and talking to me. Do you really think anyone is going to watch that? It's not very exciting. Why not? What's wrong with it? People don't listen to you going on about fashion. How do you know? How many people visited your blog last month? Thirty-two. But maybe lots of people were on holiday last month. See, you have to be funny or really entertaining if you want to have lots of visitors. Here, let's have a look at some popular blogs. I'll show you what I mean. OK. A few more visitors to my blog would be good, I suppose. That one's really funny. Look at that! I can't believe they're doing that. That's amazing. Aw, that's hilarious. Shall we have a go? No, Stephen. I really don't think that's a good idea. But do you see what I mean? Look how many views that video has. She's got a whole channel of videos. Almost a hundred thousand followers. Wow! I'd love to ask her how she got so popular. Well, let's post a comment and see if she's online. Hi, is that SunbeamsJess? Yeah, it is. Who are you guys? Hi, yeah, I'm Stephen and this is my sister, Ashlie. We've just been watching your latest upload. It's really good. Thank you. You've got loads of subscribers. How many do you have? I have about 91,000 at the moment. Wow, that is a lot. And how did you start? Well I started by watching other people's videos and then decided to make my own. At first I used the webcam in my laptop but then as I got more and more followers, I decided to switch to a camera and make higher-quality videos. I'm making my own blog and I wanted to start adding video. I wondered if you had any advice? Like, how to get more people to watch? I think the most important thing would be to choose a subject that you're really passionate about because if you love it, then your viewers will really love it too. And also it's important to remember that it is video, so choosing something that will look good on camera is also key. Sounds like good advice. Thank you, Jess. Yes, thanks for that. We'll let you go now, OK? Goodbye! Bye! Bye, thanks. Take care. That was really interesting. I think we should start our own channel. What could we make videos about? She said it should be something you're passionate about. Something you really love  ...that looks great on camera. Hmm. Poppy!\n",
            "This is going to make a great show. Don't forget Poppy has to go through the hoop. 'Stephen & Ashlie TV' - take one. Stephen, it's 'Poppy TV'! Fine. 'Stephen, Ashlie & Poppy TV', take one and action! And action. Ashlie, I said action! Stephen, I don't think she wants to do it. And I think you're shouting too much. Poppy, if you want to be a star, you need to get into character. I don't think she understands. I know. What if we give her a treat, like a dog chocolate? Then you might want to go through the hoop. Great idea, have you got one? Yeah. Here. Give it to me. Poppy, here's your treat. You're going to be the greatest dog star in the world. I don't think that's going to work, Stephen. Of course it will. Stephen, Ashlie & Poppy TV, take two. Action! I think you need to put her treat on the other side of the hoop. Good idea. Take three. Poppy! Action! I'm sure great directors never have this much trouble. Never work with animals! Aw, don't listen to him, Poppy. You've been great. Stephen's just being bossy. I'm not being bossy, I'm just trying to get the best performance out of Poppy. I'm trying to make her a star. Well, as you've been working so hard as the director, I'll edit the video and upload it to our new channel. Come on, let's go home. I'm exhausted after all that directing. I've got a sore throat and I've got a stomach ache. It must be the stress. Well, why don't you have a nap while me and Poppy work on the new channel? That's a good idea. That's it, Stephen. Wake up. I've uploaded our first video! Have you? That's great. Look, someone has posted a comment already. Really? Let's have a look. Wow, it says, 'really funny smiley face'. That's odd. Look, Stephen, we've already got some 'likes'. That's amazing. I didn't think it was funny, more like Poppy being clever. Can we see the video, Ash? Oh, erm, yeah, of course. It wasn't quite what we planned but well, you'll see. Stephen, are you ready? Hi! Welcome to Poppy TV, I'm Ashlie and this is the adorable Poppy. Look, Stephen, we're a hit! We've got thousands of views already. We're going to be famous! Noooo!\n",
            "Hi, come in. I'm Maya. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Grange Park Sports Centre. I'll just show you round the centre and explain what we offer here, and then you can ask me questions. Well, as you can see, this is quite a small centre but we offer a lot of different activities at different times of the day. If you'd just like to come through here, you can see the main rooms. These are nice and light and airy and we have a very good air-conditioning system so they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here we have classes of yoga, tai chi, Pilates and Zumba at different levels. We also have different types of dance class: jazz dancing, Indian dancing and Latin dancing. Oh, and we've just started offering flamenco. All our teachers are fully qualified and experienced. We have beginners' classes up to advanced. Some of our students have been coming since we opened, ten years ago. So, if you could follow me through here - mind the steps here - we've got the sauna and massage rooms. We have very reasonable prices for massages. And over here we have the gym with exercise machines. It's quite a small gym, but usually there's plenty of room for people to move around without any problems. OK, that's about it. Over there we have the changing rooms with showers. You do need to bring your own towel if you want a shower, but you don't need to bring a mat for the yoga and Pilates classes. Oh, and I must mention the café. It's just off the main entrance. That's very popular with our clients; we have a great selection of teas, fresh juices, sandwiches and cakes. Right, the prices. You can join for three months, six months or a year and that gives you the right to use the gym and go to two classes a week. If you want to go to more classes or use the sauna, there's a small extra charge. For three months the fee is OK, let me show you the gym. My name's Bill and I'm the main sports trainer here, but we have a team of four specialists who are always around to help you with exercise programmes and give advice about lifestyle and diet. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of us as soon as you sign up and set up your personalised training programme. So, through here we have the main gym. As you can see, it's enormous and we have lots of brand-new machines. You can do everything here, running, cycling, rowing, weights you name it. Although we have a lot of clients, it's very unusual to have to wait for a machine. Over there is the area for weight-training. If you want a closer look at the machines, you can come back later. Oh, by the way, you can only come in here with trainers on. No outdoor shoes, please. OK, through here we have the swimming pool. It's great, isn't it? We're very proud of it. You can use it most of the time without booking, but there are certain times of day when we have swimming classes and water aerobics. There is always a lifeguard in attendance who will also offer informal swimming tips. OK, just over there you have the changing rooms and lockers, and on the right are the bathrooms and showers. We have our own shop, here, where you can buy our own brand of sportswear and sports drinks and supplements. Right, I can see you're impressed, and as I said, we're very proud of our centre. However, I should warn you that we are slightly more expensive than other gyms in the area - but then we offer a much higher level of services and a very wide range of activities. Here's a brochure with the timetables of the extra classes that we offer, such as boxing, taekwondo and capoeira and quite a few others, besides swimming activities: swimming classes, diving classes, water aerobics and water polo. OK, so have a look at the brochure, then you can speak to one of the secretaries in reception about the best combination of activities for you.\n",
            "Ah, this is what I need. You don't need a tennis racket. What about this? Stephen, you never play cricket! You certainly don't need a cricket bat. What's this? I've got no idea! Come on. We need the running section. Ashlie and I are going to run a half-marathon. And this little beauty is going to help me do a really fast time. Luckily, it's not about running fast. We're running to raise money for charity. If I actually can run twenty-one kilometres. Of course you can. You're right. Think positive - I am going to do it and I am going to raise lots of money. How many sponsors have you got? Well, I've decided to concentrate on the running, as that's the most important thing. Stephen! It doesn't matter how fast you run. You're only saying that because you know I'm much faster than you. But I'm going to make the most money. Come on, Ash. Let's buy this and get to the gym. We've got work to do. Have I done 10 kilometres yet? No, Stephen. You've only been going for five minutes. That's better, Stephen. Maybe we can try something a bit harder next time. Anyway, next it's the step machine and after that some weights. 10, 11, 12... 498, 499, 500 Hey, Ash. How's it going? Wow, Stephen. You are doing really well. Five hundred already. Yeah, and I'm only warming up really. I'm getting ready for a proper workout. Even my personal trainer's impressed. I heard there's a medal for the person that gets the most sponsorship money. Ash, you're not going to get round the race unless you start getting fit and working out. You need to treat this as a proper science. Yes, Stephen. You're not going to get a good time or even finish the race unless you start training hard. I'm eating healthy food. I'm sure I'll be fine. Ash, it's 12.31. You're distracting me. I've got a timetable to follow. I've got 500 press-ups to do and then weights. I think I'll sit over there and have a nice glass of juice. Oh, is that your personal trainer? I might see if she'll sponsor me. Hello. I'm running a half-marathon. Do you think you could sponsor me? Sure. Great, thank you. Eight, nine, ten Ashlie! Ashlie! Ash! Ash! Stephen, are you OK? Yeah, can you just help me out? Yes, I'll just lift this bit. There must be something wrong with the machine. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, I think I'm okay. But I might need a rest. Oh dear, you poor thing. I'll just put these away and I'll meet you in reception.\n",
            "Ashlie, Ashlie? Are you there? Ah, no signal. I'll have to send her a text. OK, right. 'Where are you? - You are late - Race about to start.' 'On my way.' Ash, you there? Oh, hi Stephen. The race is about to start. All the runners are getting ready. I've been sorting out my outfit. What? Your outfit? Ash, this isn't the time to think about your clothes. We're running a half-marathon. It isn't a fashion show. Where are you? I'm nearly there. Where are you? I'm near the starting line. OK, I'll come and find you. OK. Hi, Stephen! Argh! Like it? It's my charity outfit. I think it's really cute. What are you wearing, Stephen? You look like er like a, er a proper runner. This is the very latest in high-tech equipment. I have satellite navigation so I know exactly where I am. I can measure how fast I run, check my heart rate. And look at this Yeah. Very impressive, Stephen. Oh look! There's Kelvin. He's the organiser. Hi, Kelvin. Hi. Great costume, Ashlie. Thanks. This is my brother, Stephen. He's running in the race, too. Hi, Stephen. I'll be back in a minute. I'm just going to get my number. See you. So Kelvin, how many runners are there here today? There's five thousand people taking part today. And a lot of money's being raised for charity. It should be a really good day. I've been training for weeks. I've been training very seriously. That's great to hear. Thank you for taking part. That's OK. I'm hoping to get a really fast time today. I'm ready to go. Excellent. The race is just about to start. See you at the finish line. OK. Thank you. Hey, look I got my number. And guess what? There's a medal for the person... A medal? What for? It's for the person who gets the fastest time. Come on, Ash. I'm ready. Let's get to the starting line. Stephen, there's a medal for the person who raises the most money! Oh come on, Ash. I've worked it out. We have to run the first 8 kilometres in 30 minutes. Really? Why? That's my race strategy. It's very complicated. Don't worry. You're going too slow, Ash. If you'd trained more, you'd be running faster. Well, it's quite a long way, Stephen, so this is fast enough for me. Oh, I'm going on ahead. I'll see you at the finish line. Good luck! But Stephen Well, must be that way. That's what the GPS says. Excuse me. I think I'm lost. Have you seen a race round here? Well done, Stephen. You finally made it. And you know what? Look what I won. I raised loads of money for charity. Isn't it fantastic? Oh, Stephen!\n",
            "Golf is a sport played all over the world. But wherever you are, after you've hit your shot, there can be a long walk to go and get your ball. But now, there's a new way to get around the golf course. You just hop on, and I'll see you down there. This simple idea, to make a small and lightweight golf cart which will fold and fit in the boot of the car, was invented by a British engineering student. Now, just a few years later, the RolleyGolf is being sold around the world. That student inventor is now an international businessman Hello! Hello! and the winner of several young entrepreneur awards. So Arnold, how did you come up with the idea? RolleyGolf's idea came up at university when I was studying design and we took that design to a golf course and discovered there was a niche in the market. So you actually sold some before you'd even built them? Yes, we created one RolleyGolf, and on the basis of one RolleyGolf, we built many for clients. And do you still play golf? It's my major passion in life. Well, let's go! Let's do it. Arnold is one of thousands of young people in Britain with ideas for a new business. One famous businessman who helps young people get started is Sir Richard Branson. He was once in Arnold's position, facing the same challenges as a young entrepreneur. Now, he's the head of the massive Virgin group, which includes mobile phone, media and travel companies. They sponsor Virgin Pioneers, which was set up to support young business people. Sir Richard, as a businessman, what was it like for you when you started? Ah It's difficult You know, 45 years ago when I started off in business, the word entrepreneur didn't really exist, so for many years all that really mattered was the word survival. And I sort of threw myself in the deep end and had to fight to survive. And I suppose I was lucky to survive, and lucky that Virgin grew into the company it has today. Do you think it's a good time to start a business in Britain? I think it's a great time to start a business anywhere in the world. If, you know, what is a business? A business is just coming up with an idea that's going to make a positive difference to other people's lives. If you've got an idea like that, you know, just do it. Other young pioneers gave their advice too. My top tips for young entrepreneurs all over the world are to believe in yourself, be passionate about your idea, if you have a dream, you have to do everything in your power to make that happen. Surround yourself with people that can help lift you and your business higher. Meet as many people as you can. Talk to as many people as you can. Just get started as soon as possible. Start small, but do get started. Arnold wanted to produce his golf cart in Britain. This was difficult, because a lot of companies these days manufacture their products in East Asia, especially China. Arnold's company now make around 50 of his products every single month, and many of the parts are handmade in this small workshop in South London. Can I come in? Michael Winch cuts and shapes many of the parts for the cart in his workshop. What we do is we receive a piece of raw material and machine it and we make it into something which is more valuable than the original piece of material. So it sounds like a lot of hard work, but do you enjoy it? It's great fun, yeah. Arnold's invention is now legal on the roads in Britain, so I'm sure he won't mind if I borrow one to get home. See ya!\n",
            "I want to talk about my life in UK. I went to study in the UK a few years ago. The most exciting experience is that I went to a host family for my Christmas holiday in December. I went there alone on a train. It took me about one or two hours to get there, to York, and then I stayed there for one week. This was the first time that I spent time with a UK family, which I learned a lot from them. They treat me like a family member, they took me out to eat, to play and to see all the different interesting culture of their region. On Christmas Day, they even bought me some presents to celebrate the Christmas. When I went back to Oxford, which was the place that I stayed for that year, I had the chance to teach in a Chinese school every Sunday. The kids are about 14 years old and I taught them Chinese. They were very cute but they all speak in English. I spent lots of time to encourage them to speak in Cantonese. During my study in the UK, I lived with few other students from different countries. They are very nice and we used to cook on our own, just like a big family. Every day we will go to every day we went to supermarkets to buy food and drinks and desserts. We cooked every day. I was not a good cook - normally I just put everything into oven. And I've tried to bake a cake before but failed and they all laughed at me. And every time when I bake a cake, they never taste it. We share a flat together - we share kitchen, bathrooms but we do have our own sink and bedroom. The life in the UK is quite relaxing besides study because you can explore more and do different activities at school or even some other extracurricular activities. After I come back Hong Kong, I still keep in touch with all my friends in the UK, from different countries like Italy, Malaysia, Japan, UK and other countries. Sometimes we even send email to each other, sometimes they may come to Hong Kong to visit and we will meet each other again. I really enjoy the time in the UK. I hope you will also have the chance to explore more in other different countries in the future.\n",
            "Help! Somebody help me! ... Please! Help! Help! We've got a survivor here! There's a survivor here! ... Be careful! Ready? One. Two. Three! ... OK. You're going to be OK. Stay with me... Stay with me. Oh no. No, no, no, no... Her heart's stopped! Help me get her into the ambulance! We need to get to the hospital, now! Give me the machine! ... Clear! ... Stay with me... No, no, no, no... Clear!  ... and police are still looking into the mysterious accident. The small private plane crashed while it was taking off from a local airport at 10 p.m. last night. People on the scene say they saw the plane take off and then crash into a field. We know that two people are dead, and one person is in the hospital, in critical condition. The police say they do not yet know the cause of the crash, but it looks like the pilot lost control of the aeroplane. We'll have more updates on this news story as it comes in... Good morning! And how are we this morning? You're very lucky, you know. Not everybody can survive a plane crash. And here you are. You're the only survivor, in fact. The doctors said that they couldn't find any identification on you at the crash site. Everything was burning. But you're going to be OK, don't worry. The doctors also say they don't know if you can hear anything or not. I don't know either, but I like talking so I think I'll keep talking to you, if that's OK. Is that OK? You need a name. We don't have your name. So at the moment, we have to give you a name. Jane Doe. I need to complete some paperwork. I'm going to write your name as Jane Doe, but it's only for now. When you wake up, you can tell me your real name. OK? Oh, I forgot to tell you my name! How rude of me. So, my name is Jenny Bryson. I'm your nurse. I'm originally from England, but I've lived here for six years. I like it here. Do you like it here, Jane? Not in this hospital, but in this town? Are you from here? That's OK, you can tell me when you wake up. Let's finish that paperwork now then, Jane.\n",

We know that two people are dead, and one person is in the hospital, in critical condition. My name is Jenny Bryson. I'm your nurse You're very lucky, you know. Not everybody can survive a plane crash. And here you are. You're the only survivor, in fact. Two months before the plane crash... Welcome to the Bank Robbery Department of the bureau, Agent Kowalski. I'm Agent Sanders. You're with me. Yes, thanks. It's not my first day, you know. I know. I read your file. You were in another department for five years before this. You worked mostly in an office. This is your big promotion. You are going to be in the field now. Yes, Agent Sanders. I'm happy to be here. Who am I working with? You're working with me. I'm your partner and, for the moment, your boss. Are you OK with that? Yes. Yes. Of course, I just didn't think... You didn't think what? Nothing. So, what's our job? Well, as I said, this is the Bank Robbery Department of the bureau. Yes? So we are going to catch some bank robbers. Good morning, Jane! And how are you this morning? You have a visitor, Jane. Agent Kowalski, from the FBI. He said he had to see you. Now, I know you're tired, Jane, so he will only be here a little while, OK? Agent Kowalski, this is my patient. She's still asleep, OK? She can't talk to you. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm afraid I have to see her, though. I won't be long. Just don't you upset my Jane. Jane? Yes, Jane Doe. It's the name we gave her We don't know her real name. Ah. OK. How is she? Well, you should ask the doctor. She is very lucky to be alive. She's in a coma, but we hope she will come out of it. Can she hear us? We don't know. They say that some people like this can hear everything. Other people... can't hear anything. We don't know. Did she have anything with her? Where are her personal things? She only had some clothes on when she got here. No identification, or purse. No phone. I'm going to have to take her fingerprints, OK? Well... is that necessary? Yes, I'm afraid so. So... was she on the plane? We found her very near the place where the plane crashed, yes. But was she a passenger? The doctor told me there were only two people on the plane. They were both men. They are both dead. I'm not really allowed to talk about the investigation. There. That should be enough. Thank you, Nurse... Bryson. Nurse Bryson. Well, Nurse Bryson, that will be all for today. If she wakes up, will you please call me? Of course. Actually, could you please go outside and give my colleague your details? Name, phone number, just for the record. OK... Just go outside for a moment and see my colleague. His name's Scott. He's just outside. I can't really leave the patient here alone... She won't be alone. I'll be here. I just need to make a couple of notes. OK, then... 'Jane Doe', huh? ... Now. Jane Doe You can hear me, can't you? ... I know your real name, Agent Sanders... I'll see you around, Jane. Wake up soon.\n",

Give me another 24 hours. We're partners, Sanders. We need to share information. Tell me what is happening... This is not a secure line. We don't use names. Whatever. Fine. Have you found the money? I think so. I'm close. I can't say more right now. Yes, you can. You can... Good morning, Jane! How are you? ... Oh dear, that's the doctor. Just a second. Yes? ... No, our Jane Doe is fine. Let's look at her chart... Hmm. It says here that last night, well, her heart was beating faster, as if she were stressed. But there was no other change. And now she's back to normal, I think... Yes, doctor. Of course, doctor. Hello? Are you... Nurse Bryson? That's right. Can I help you? My name is Officer Brian Garner. I'm with the sheriff's department. Sorry it took so long for someone to come over here. That's all right, officer. What can I do to help? I'm here to see your patient, and ask you a few questions. Well, I've already told your friend from the FBI everything. FBI? Friend? What are you talking about? Agent Kowalski. The young man who was here yesterday. Hmm. Strange... Nobody told us this. Did this man show you his identification? Yes... I think so. I don't remember. I mean, I've never seen an FBI identification badge, so what would I know? Don't worry. They never tell us anything. Anyway, do you have any identification for your patient here? Clothes, personal items, jewellery? Anything like that? There were some clothes, yes. But no identification. We're calling her Jane Doe. Hmm. Jane Doe. OK. Listen. Here's my card. If those guys from the FBI show up, can you give me a call? It would be good to share any information we find. Of course. I wonder... What is it? Do you think Jane is in trouble? I don't know. But I wonder if this is connected with the big robbery a few months ago. Robbery? Yeah. Two months ago a bank truck with over two million dollars was robbed. The criminals were never caught, and the money disappeared. What does that have to do with Jane? The truck was robbed near that airport. Oh. It's probably nothing. Just coincidence. Anyway, I should go. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.\n",

I don't want anything to drink. I shouldn't even be here. Calm down, Buddy. Everything is going to be OK. They know. They know about you. They know I've been talking to you. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Who knows? The other guys from the bank job. The robbery. They know about you. They know you're an FBI agent. They know I've been talking to you. That's ridiculous. Nobody knows about this. They have someone on the inside. At the FBI. Working in your department. I can't believe this. I'm dead. I'm so dead! Relax. Just listen... No, you listen. I've got the money. Here, in a bag. I'm leaving tonight. You took the money? How? I was there, for the robbery. And I saw where they kept the money and so I took it. Anyway, I'm getting out of here tonight. I can help you. Let me help you. I can... protect you. Protect me? No, no, no. You don't understand. These guys don't just rob banks. They kill people. And they have a friend in the FBI. Two million dollars is a lot of money, OK? I think that money will keep me safer than your protection. Wait, I...

I need you to wake up, Agent Sanders. I need you to wake up and tell me where the money is. You see, I know it was either you or Buddy who took the money... Because the money wasn't on the plane. That means someone hid it somewhere before the plane took off. I need to find the money. I'm in trouble with some dangerous people, Sanders. The people who robbed that bank. If I get the money for them, everything will be OK... And I think you know where the money is. Do you know where it is? I know you can't speak. But perhaps you can move your finger. Here... just let me put my phone here, under your hand. I want you to tap the phone. One tap means yes. Two taps means no... Do you understand me? ... You CAN hear me, Sanders. And I think you can move a finger. Answer me... Fine. Maybe I'll talk to your little brother... You think I don't know about your little brother? The only family you have left? Oh, we know about him. He lives alone. He hasn't seen you for years. He doesn't have a job... Maybe I'll pay him a visit and talk to him. Maybe I can make him help me... If you don't answer me right now, I'm getting on a plane to New York. You know what I'll do, right? Good. Good. Let's get started, then. Hello? Excuse me, what are you doing here? I'm Agent Kowalski, FBI. Just visiting your patient here. It's 10 p.m. There are no visitors allowed now. Of course. Of course. I'll come back later, then. Sorry, I didn't realise the time.

Agent Kowalski, you told me to call you if there was a change with Jane. Well, there has been a change. It's not very good I'm afraid. What's happened? She's woken up. She has? That's wonderful. Yes, but she's still in critical condition. She's awake now, but only for a little while. She doesn't really know who she is or where she is. The doctors want to put her back into a coma, but I thought you might want to talk to her first. You see she... she might not survive. Listen. You have to keep her awake. I need to speak to her. I only need five minutes. But do not let her go back to sleep. OK. I'll... I'll try. Nurse? Hello? Yes, in here. I'm with Ja..., I mean Monica. Monica? There's someone here to see you. OK.

So. I guess I should say congratulations. You woke up. Do you have something to tell me? You have to promise me. Promise me my brother will be OK. That depends, Sanders. It depends on if you tell me what I need to know. Promise! All right. All right. I promise. OK? Thank you. You want to know... you want to know about the money? Yes, that's right. You want to know where it is? Yes, I want to know where it is! Stop wasting my time. How long? What? How long what? How long have you been working with those bank robbers on this? What do you mean? Buddy. Buddy told me you were working with the bank robbers. He said... said you'd gone bad. And you believed him? I'm not working for anyone, Sanders. Sure I was helping those criminals but only when it was good for me. I'm not really working for them. Not bank robbers, not even the government. Not really. I'm just working for myself now. Is it worth it? To do this to the Bureau? To let criminals go free? To say you are going to hurt my brother? Are you kidding? It's two million dollars. I'd do anything for that. You bet it's worth it. You're wrong... Listen. No more small talk. Tell me where it is. There isn't much time left. You hear that? You are going back into a coma. If you want to save your brother, you tell me right now where the money is. You're... you're... Tell me! You are under arrest, Kowalski. What? What are you talking about? Agent Nick Kowalski, my name is Officer Brian Garner. You are under arrest. What is going on? It's all here, Kowalski. I have it all recorded. Nurse? I set up the phone, just like you asked me to.  ... Are you kidding? It's two million dollars. I'd do anything for that. You bet it's worth it. ... Mr Kowalski, you are going to have to come with me. Monica! You did it. What... You're finished, Kowalski. Well, enjoy this moment, Sanders. Enjoy it, before you go back to sleep. Oh, I don't think so. My Jane, I mean, Monica, is doing quite well. But... Oh, I told you she had only a little time to live? I'm happy to say that's not true. Monica is much better now. She should be on her feet in the next 24 hours. I'll be at your trial, Kowalski. And the money...? We just had a phone call telling us the location of the money. A police car is on its way now. That was me, Kowalski. That's enough now. You're coming with me. I want my lawyer. Get off me! Well, Monica. That was exciting. It was, wasn't it? What are you going to do now? Now? I think I might have a little nap.\n",
            "Good morning. Today we're going to talk about theme parks and we're going to hear from Andy Wells who has written a guide to theme parks around the world. Welcome to the programme, Andy. Hi, it's good to be here. You really have a dream job, don't you, Andy? Flying round the world all the time, visiting adventure parks... Well, yes, it's pretty exciting. But it's really hard work too, you know. I bet. So, what's the number one theme park in the world? That all depends what you're looking for. In terms of numbers, it has to be Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, the most famous theme park. But the most popular park for people who like adventure rides is Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. It has the biggest number of rollercoasters in one park, 17, and three water rides. There are lots of other attractions too. Last year they introduced 50 animatronic dinosaurs. You know, life-size models that move and look real. Cool! Have they got anything lined up for this year? Yeah, there's a new rollercoaster called the Gatekeeper. Well, actually it's not a rollercoaster, it's a wingcoaster. It'll be the biggest in the world. What's a wingcoaster? With a normal rollercoaster you are sitting on a seat with the track under you. With a wingcoaster the seats kind of stick out at the side so the passengers have nothing below or above them. You feel as if you're flying. So it's more frightening? More exciting! Way more exciting. What other attractions have you seen recently? I've just been to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. It's great! You know those shops that sell magic sweets and things in the Harry Potter books? Well, they have those, just like you've imagined. There's a fantastic tour of Hogwarts School where you meet characters from the books. It's so well done. Right, sounds interesting. In your book you have a lot of theme parks in Asia too. Can you tell us about them? Sure. Tokyo has had a Disneyland for quite a long time, which attracts a lot of people. Ocean Park in Hong Kong has also been going for a long time - that has a lot of marine animals as well as rides. Lotte World, a huge park in South Korea, has the world's biggest indoor theme park. And then there's Universal Studios in Singapore. That's expanding with additions to its New York street section. There's going to be a Sesame Street dark ride. A dark ride's a ride inside a building. I see. New York in Singapore? Yeah, it's weird, but it works. But the place to watch at the moment is China - they're really expanding. Lots more parks will open in China in the next few years, including another one with dinosaurs in the north, and Ocean Kingdom in the south. That will have the world's longest roller coaster and tallest Ferris wheel, as well as boat rides and a night-time zoo. Wow, so that's opening soon? Yes, this year. I'll be there! Have a ride for me, then.\n",
            "So, have you got any plans for the weekend? Yeah, me and my mates are going to this activity centre in the mountains. Oh, yeah? You can do all kinds of things. It's a new centre; it sounds great. We're going to go dirtboarding What's that? It's like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They're pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks. Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before? No, but I've done similar things. Anyway, we're also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that's when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we'll go white water rafting too. Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me. They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain. Go down a mountain on a wire! It's really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there's bungee jumping. Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You've got to be joking! Anyway, I'm going away this weekend too, thank you for asking. I was going to ask. So where are you going? Paris! I'm so excited! Paris, wow! Yeah, it'll be brilliant! We're going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can't wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings. I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else. Yeah, I know, they're in the Musée d'Orsay. We're going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we're in Paris, we'll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there's the restaurants. Just think, French food! You've got a lot planned for one weekend. Oh, we're going for four days, actually. Oh, four days, very nice. And who are you going with? Oh, just a friend.\n",
            "There she is! Hi! Great to see you Ash - this is Jazz. Hi, nice to meet you, Jazz. Nice to meet you Ashlie. I have never been here before. I have always wanted to visit London. Wow, this is your first visit to London - you've never been here before? Well, I'm glad you could come - we're really looking forward to showing you around. Come on. Let's get going. Here, let me help you with this bag. What have you got in here? It weighs a ton. Oh - come on. We need to get a move on. Stephen's brought his friend Jazz over to London for a few days. So we're going to give him a tour of the city and show him the sights. Come on Ash - we need to get to central London for your surprise. Surprise? What for me? I've got a surprise! Hi there. Hi. We need to get to the River Thames. Can you take us to Embankment - near the tube station? Embankment Station, OK. Oh no! My bag! Where's my bag? I can't believe it I've lost it. Damn it! I'm going to have to go back there and get it. Did you have it with you on the train? Are you sure you had it with you on the train? You had your bag on the train, definitely - you put it on the... err... How do you say that in English? The luggage rack - yeah. Did you put it on the luggage rack, Ash? You're right - I'm sure I had it with me on the train. Oh my gosh! My phone! My phone is in my bag. Oh, I'm going to have to go back. But Ashlie, you'll miss the surprise. Oh, how annoying! You guys go on ahead and I'll catch you up later. Are you sure? Yes, don't worry. I'll give you a call later. Oh gosh! This is an amazing city. What is that building over there? Oh, that's the Royal Albert Hall... I hope we're going to get there on time. The traffic in London is terrible. Is the traffic always this bad? Ah - you should see it in rush hour. Sometimes it's quicker to walk. In fact, maybe we should are you OK with walking? Is it a long way? It's about ten minutes' walk to the flat from here. OK, that's fine. I think we can manage with these bags. Can you pull over here, please? It's only half an hour to the surprise - we'll have to hurry. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait, I want to take a photo. Wow, I have never seen anything like this before. Where are we? What is this place called? This is Piccadilly Circus. There's always loads of tourists round here. Wow, I must take a photograph, just one minute. When we get to Trafalgar Square, we can stop for a quick rest. Come on. Jazz What's that? It's a phone. Is that your phone? No. Hey, I don't believe it. Look what I've found! Isn't this Ashlie's bag? It's her phone! What? Oh no! We had it all along. Poor Ashlie. I'm going to answer it. Hello? Stephen? Hello. This isn't Ashlie - I'm Stephen, I'm Ashlie's brother. Stephen! But this is Ashlie's phone. What are you doing with my phone? Who's that? Stephen it's me - Ashlie - Where are you? Ash, we've found your stuff. We had it with us all the time. Oh - I can't believe I came all the way back here for nothing. Yes, don't worry, we've got your bag. Everything's safe. Thank goodness it's all turned up. I'm so relieved. Right, well get here as quick as you can. We're going to drop the bags off at the flat. Great. And thank you! Meet you at the Embankment. Don't be late. Remember, I've got a surprise for you! OK, I'll see you later. Bye!\n",
            "Do you know how many different types of transport we have been on today? Well, we arrived on a plane, and then took a train, then a taxi - and now we're on a boat on the River Thames! Wow - amazing. I didn't realise people in London travelled around on boats. Well, there's a lot less traffic on the river and it's a great way to see the sights. Ah - there's Ashlie. Hi guys. Ah, I'm glad to have these back. Well, here we are! Brilliant. Are we going to the London Eye? We are and I've got our tickets! Oh, what a great surprise, Stephen. I've always wanted to go on the London Eye! And the view of London from up there is amazing. Oh, and the weather's so good, we'll be able to see loads. Oh, I can't wait. There you go mate, the Houses of Parliament. There's Big Ben. Over there is St Paul's Cathedral. What a view. Wow this is amazing. The City looks great from up here. That's a strange building. What is that? Oh, that's what we call the Gherkin - is one of London's famous office blocks. Cool. This is fantastic. And there's one thing we haven't done today? Here's something to remind you of your trip to London. Oh, the London Underground. We haven't been on the London Underground today. Thank you so much, Stephen. I'm never going to forget this day! Let's get some food, you guys must be hungry. What do you want to do? Shall we get a takeaway or eat in? Sorry? A take-away or eat in? What do you mean? Eat in, when we eat in the restaurant or take-away, when we take the food home with us. OK. Let's get take-away, shall we? So what do you fancy then, Pizza? Pizza's good. Yes, pizza sounds good. And I know a great place right near the flat. Oh no! You guys are never going to believe this I've left my purse on the London eye!\n",
            "Hey, guys. My name is Nicole and I'm a Greenfingers Changemaker. Today, we are going to use plastic to make things like wall murals, dresses, accessories and art. Now, the interesting thing is, we pick up plastic that you all have disposed on the ground. And we treasure them and we use them to make designs. Now, I'm about to show you how we can use plastic to make amazing things. So we went on a plastic drive, meaning we collected plastic from the street and in our estates for recycling. The caps are not useless - we use them for projects like this, which is a wall mural. So, we're mixing the cement and plastering it on the wall. Then we're taking the bottle caps and putting it on the cement on the wall, to make a beautiful flower mosaic. Hi, guys. Hi. How far have you guys gone? We're making progress. We've made some pairs of earrings, bracelets. And we're making necklaces right now. So we are making jewellery out of supposed plastic waste. Plastic that you guys have disposed, plastic like cups, bottles and so much more. These jewelleries are 95 per cent waste. We get plastic and cut them out into different shapes and patterns. And we use fishing line to secure the beads. And the fishing and the hooks to the plastic. Last Christmas, my friends and I made a Christmas tree out of plastic bottles. Now, we got green plastic bottles and poked holes in them, passed wire through them and wrapped it round the frame. We made plastic dresses to protest against the use of single-use plastics. We are telling everyone out there to stop using single-use plastics, or, even if you do use them, learn to recycle them.\n",
            "The sound of bells in an English churchyard. The bells signal a very special event for one couple because today is their wedding day. Stevie and Bobby are engaged and are allowing Word on the Street to follow them on their special day when they become man and wife. The day starts very early in the morning for the bride, Stevie, and bridesmaids help her with the preparations. I spoke to Stevie as she was getting ready. How are you feeling? Feeling a little bit nervous but very excited. And what have you got left to do? Just having my hair done now, then put on my dress after. Across town at Bobby's house, there is lots of food to prepare and Bobby's also getting ready. Nice to meet you. So it's your big day today? It is. Fantastic. Is this the main suit? It is. This is it. Brilliant. Just check it fits all OK, it's ironed well Yep. It looks good. Bobby and Stevie are having a traditional Christian wedding in a church. But today in Britain there are many different marriage ceremonies, depending on the religion or beliefs of the couple. A civil ceremony is a non-religious legal marriage that takes place somewhere other than a place of worship. Same-sex couples can also get married in Britain. To understand more about today's ceremony, I met the vicar who's going to be leading it. What are the origins of this marriage ceremony? This marriage ceremony goes back first to the Reformation in the 16th century and then further back in time and it is a standard Christian wedding with Christian vows made in the name of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And what's your advice for a long and successful marriage? A good deal of tolerance, a willingness to ask for help and a sense of humour. The groom arrives first, and waits for his bride. The atmosphere at a wedding is a mixture of pride, joy and celebration. There may be a few tears, too - of happiness. The bride arrives in a horse-drawn carriage, accompanied by her father. And now the ceremony can begin. Bobby and Stevie have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife. With those important words and the signing of the official register, Bobby and Stevie are now legally husband and wife. After some photographs to record the big day, everybody will go to a local hall for dinner and a big party called the reception. So a big congratulations to the newly married couple from Word on the Street!\n",
            "It's the most popular game on Earth. From kids playing in the street to professional players in huge stadiums, more people play and watch this game than any other. And now football, or soccer, is more popular than ever among British girls and women. There are more than 5,000 girls' youth teams registered in England. I'm here to meet some of the rising stars of Tottenham Hotspur, also known as Spurs, here in London. We're just a few minutes down the road from the famous White Hart Lane soccer stadium. Spurs Football Club was set up more than 130 years ago. It's now one of the most famous clubs in the world, playing in the English Premier League. Women's teams have been playing at Spurs since the 1980s. These players are the Spurs Ladies Academy Team, and if any of them are good enough I'm rubbish at this they could progress to the Spurs Women's First Team. What I really like about football is the competitive side, wanting to win games I just enjoy the competition, the atmosphere not being discriminated because of your sex Like, you're with all your friends playing football, you're all doing the same thing that you love. I think it's really fun, actually. Today we're following Kitty as she trains for a big match. Kitty, how did you get into football? I've been playing football since I was 9. I started playing in a park and got picked up by a coach. And now I've moved up to Tottenham Hotspur. Are you treated any differently to the boys that play football? No, not at all. We get a lot of support and the same standard of coaching. The girls' team coach is Karen Hills. Over the last 20 years, football for ladies in this country has changed dramatically. When I was playing, there wasn't many opportunities within schools. There are many teams that cater for girls' football. There are leagues set up, there's a structure in place from playing all the way up to Senior England Ladies football. It's now several weeks later and time to put all that training into practice. Spurs Ladies Academy are playing Barking Abbey in the British Colleges League - Division One. It's a big match for Kitty, so how's she feeling? Today's going to be really competitive. There are two good sides who are pretty familiar with each other. So I'm feeling quite nervous about the game today. The teams are pretty evenly matched, but five minutes into the game, Spurs go one-nil up, and it's Kitty who scores! Barking quickly hit back with a goal of their own. Just before half time, Spurs score a second goal. And then, in the second half, Kitty has a chance to make it three-one. The final score is three-two and Kitty's team have won. So, Kitty, not only did your team win but you scored two of the goals. How does that feel? Thank you, yeah, that was I'm not I haven't scored like that for a long time, actually. And it's only early in the season, isn't it, but do you think, judging from how you guys played there, do you think it's going to be a good season? Yeah, definitely. I can see everyone improving every single week. And, like they helped me a lot, like, I didn't get those goals by myself. And what does it feel like to score those goals? I had goose bumps from the second one. It felt so good. So, it's a great start to the season, but there are many more matches left to play. And from what we've seen today and in training, there's plenty more excitement and tension to look forward to.\n",
            "The world of fashion never stays still. Styles, colours and combinations change along with every season, year after year. It may look glamorous and fun, but it takes hard work and dedication to make a career in fashion. Many people now study fashion at college or university in the UK, where they'll need to understand skills including design, materials, distribution, marketing - and have lots of creative flair. All the people at this fashion shoot have studied at college, but now they're working, they're still learning all the time. I went to the London College of Communication. The real training that I kind of got that helps me today is just from assisting photographers, working in studios and just, really, just shooting my own stuff. Make-up artist: I think I'm still learning every day because there are new products, new people, different equipment I went to the Royal College of Arts, where I sort of learned more about textile design and fashion and a little bit more about the industry from a different perspective. Fashion designer Alex d'Arche is now putting that education to practical use. I like that. That's really nice. She now works in the family business, called Daisy Darche. That's really nice. Alex's business is based in London, where she designs and manufactures her range of clothes. So, show me some of your work. Yes, this is some of my work. So these pieces are from the latest spring/summer collection, and here are some other pieces which are made to order. Where do you get your inspiration from for these textiles? I like going to museums, a lot of travelling involved, so I went to India, China, Thailand really anywhere, even going for a walk in the park, you never know what you can see. Alex hires in the photographer, model and make-up artist for her fashion shoots to show off her range of clothes in magazines and online. But what does it take to work in the fashion industry? Make-up artist: To be a good make-up artist you need to be a good communicator, creative and tough-skinned for the industry. I couldn't imagine myself working in an office, you know, 9 to 5. I just absolutely love photography and to make a living with, you know, through my work it's fun, yeah, I really, really enjoy it. Definitely, you have to have a passion, and you just have to keep going. The training Alex has received has helped her create a successful business. Do you think for you, you had to go to university to learn what you do now? I think, erm, in any industry, I think it's important to go to university. I think there's no limit to what you can learn, and I think you can only make yourself better. So, now you're in fashion, is it all glamour? No but it can be, it can be. It is what you make it. So, as I've discovered today, behind the glamour of the fashion world is a lot of hard work and a wide set of skills. The reward for designers like Alex is choosing the styles which people are wearing from season to season.\n",
            "Good morning, everyone. On today's show, we've got Chris Svensson with us, the author of No more nine to five, the new best-selling book about work-life balance in the current working world. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for coming. Thanks for having me, Anna. So, Chris, tell us about your book and how the concept of a work-life balance has been changing? Well, in the more traditional workplaces, people's working lives and their private lives are, or were, clearly divided. People often work from nine in the morning until five or six in the evening. People sometimes stay late in the office and work in the evenings. This is called working overtime. OK, and what else? Well, in these environments it isn't common for people to work at the weekend or while they're on holiday. They can clearly separate their working lives and their private lives. And the evenings, weekends and holidays are free to focus on non-work areas of life, such as hobbies, interests, sports, spending time with the family and friends, and so on. It's important and healthy not to spend all your time just working, right? Right! So what has changed? How are things different now? Well, for a start, most people can now access their work emails from their mobile phones. So they are more likely to quickly reply to an important mail in the evening or at the weekend. The same goes for laptops. It's easier to access your work in the evenings from home or even from your hotel when you're on holiday. That doesn't sound like much of a work-life balance. It sounds like all work. Exactly, but this new mobility brings a lot of advantages with it. More people are now able to work flexibly, so if they need to leave the office early one afternoon to be with their family, they can catch up on work that evening from home or somewhere else. That sounds good. So, what you're saying is that although traditional divisions between work and life are fading, many employees now have more freedom to do their work from different locations and at different times. Yes, that's it.\n",
            "When I was a little kid, my father used to watch a lot of old movies and I sat with him and loved them too, especially the musicals. So you see, my career was inspired by him in a way and these old movies played a big part in my life. They were the reason I wanted to learn to sing, though my dad never suggested it to me. There's no musical background in my family, though my mother could sing but she didn't have much ability really. It was just fun for her. I think my parents must have looked at me and thought, where did that come from?\n",
            "Well I think that new clothes store called Smart Girls is certainly a place where you can be sure of picking up a bargain or two, though most of the shops in the mall have them at the moment. The assistants are friendly and they really know about fashion instead of just pretending to be cool. They're honest too, and don't just tell you that you look great all the time. I like the music they play because it sort of puts you in the mood as soon as you walk in, though I don't think it's your thing. You might prefer somewhere a bit quieter.\n",
            "So, Josh, for our teenage listeners who live in towns and cities, tell us about what it's like living on a farm. Well, actually, you can come along and experience it for yourself this weekend. There's going to be something called an open farm day. More than 450 farms all over the country will be open to the public, and you can go along and meet the animals, ride on a tractor, learn about cheese-making and wool spinning, all that sort of thing. Who knows? It might even persuade a few to think about farming as a career. It's not an easy life, but it's a good one.\n",
            "Hi Judy, are you ready for the school concert tomorrow? I've been practicing all week, so I think it'll be okay There are a few tricky bits in that new piece of music. We'll be playing. I'm getting my head round it though My clarinet was making a funny noise, but I've got it sorted now that could have been embarrassing I'm a bit worried about my solo part especially with all those people watching Imagine how awful it would be to make a mistake with your mum and dad there. I'm not so bothered about strangers though Just stay cool. If you mess up, just keep going like nothing's happened\n",
            "Fast food is off the menu for everyone at Parktown Rangers Football Club. The new manager of the club has coached in many countries around the world and has picked up some ideas from his travels in Europe and Asia. He has banned the players from eating meat when they are preparing for important games. He thinks this will strengthen their physical condition and improve the team's results, a view shared by our medical experts in the studio today. Now the club have decided to go a step further and have stopped selling burgers in the stadium, a move which may not be popular with all the young fans.\n",
            "I read this great newspaper the other day. A newspaper? Isn't it full of dull stuff? It's aimed at our age group actually, so it presents the news in a way that's easy to understand. So it's a good way to find out what's going on in the world. It's interactive too. Really? Yeah. You can write reports for it and they include the best ones in the paper. Cool, huh? If you like writing I suppose. Not a talent of mine. So you don't bother with the news then? Oh, I wouldn't say that. I do follow it. Just as long as it doesn't seem too much like schoolwork.\n",
            "How often do you go mountain climbing? My dad and I go climbing together a lot, which is really cool because I get plenty of time to talk with him. I remember the last mountain we climbed together, he was telling me about how you can only really enjoy the wonderful scenery once you get to the top, because when you're just halfway up, you're concentrating on the climb. I was really sore and I just wanted to quit, but I carried on to the top so I could admire the beautiful view. But my legs were aching so much I couldn't appreciate it fully, or my dad's wise words.\n",
            "Right everyone, I'm sure you'll agree it was great fun enhancing our school grounds with the butterfly garden and I hope you all got something out of it and are more aware of your natural environment now. What you've achieved is much appreciated and the project will continue so I'd like you to keep thinking about things we can do to maintain the garden. The idea is to keep it going for future students at the school so all suggestions are welcome. I think you'll all agree it's been a great success which I hope we can repeat in the future.\n",
            "So many young people sign up for my lessons to learn the art of drawing cartoons. Regardless of experience, everyone finds their drawing technique improves in record time with my simple step-by-step drawing lessons. Whether it's your first time learning how to draw, or whether you've got plenty of experience, you'll appreciate my method because I make it seem so straightforward. It's true! You can learn to draw cartoons without stress, though, like anything in life, it's up to you if you want to take it further. Be ready to practice on your own. You'll find drawing cartoons is one of the most satisfying things you can learn to do.\n",
            "I have a hobby which is super fun and superbly unique. Unicycling, you know, a one-wheel bike, isn't as easy as it looks but you can learn how to do it. You can either try learning it from someone who already knows how to do it, which is what I did at first, or take a course. What makes unicycling so cool is that you can make up your own tricks on it like hopping and jumping. Now I go to classes every week to make sure I learn new moves and perfect them by going over them again and again. Sometimes I take part in unicycling competitions too. They're good fun. Now everyone reckons that learning how to dance is a very interesting hobby, but at first I wasn't so sure. Dancing can be really fun to do as well as to watch, and so is good for everyone. Mind you, some types of dancing can be quite challenging and difficult and require a lot of dedication and precision. That's why I love my street dance classes. They're really aimed at people like me who don't want to study every type of dance, but who just like to enjoy themselves. And you make friends too. Maybe one day I'll be good enough to enter a dance competition, but I'm not counting on it. My dad's hobby is photography and he's passed this on to me. He says every hobby's got a practical and technical side, and I mostly agree. My view is that photography is actually an art, much more than just pointing a camera and taking a photo. I think learning about photography is a great hobby for me because we have an opportunity to put our photos in competitions too, and that's what makes it really worthwhile. I know it isn't as challenging as it used to be because now there are digital cameras and you can change things on your computer, but it's still really exciting. Singing's an art, and learning how to sing can be a good hobby. There are many ways to enjoy this hobby, whether you practice on your own, join a choir, or just use a karaoke machine with your friends. I get a real buzz from seeing the look on their faces when it's my turn to sing. I'm not creative enough to write my own songs, but I do make sure that I pick the best ones available because it does make a difference. Sometimes I have singing classes and my teacher says I should go in for competitions, but I'm not sure how my friends would react to that idea. You'll be surprised, but I would say cooking's become a real cool hobby for me and my friends these days. With all the new kinds of innovations coming in the cooking field, more and more people are getting interested in cooking delicious food for themselves, as well as their family. I even like the idea of becoming a chef once. Now I go to cookery classes where we compete with each other to see who can prepare the best meal. I do find some recipes demanding, but that's the fun of it for me, like baking cupcakes. If I keep trying again and again, I'll get better and better.\n",
            "My guest today is champion swimmer Helen Gibson. Helen, welcome. Was swimming always your sport as a kid? Well, I come from a pretty sporty family actually, and both my older brothers were strong swimmers. Which put me off a bit at first because I never stood a chance of beating them. So I actually took up running. That was my dad's sport and was something I could share with him. He'd take me running along by these canals. I was always a bit frightened of falling in, so he and mum convinced me to have some swimming coaching to build up my confidence in the water. And of course, it wasn't long before I gave up the running altogether. So why did the swimming go so well? People at the club I joined said I was a natural swimmer, but I didn't believe them till I started winning regional championships, then national. Then I was like, wow, I can do this. I'm pretty focused generally. Things aren't worth doing if you're not passionate about them. Not everybody has that drive. It's a tough sport though, and ultimately it was down to me. And of course I was fortunate to have all the facilities I needed nearby. So what was your training schedule like in those early years? Very intensive really. Every spare moment when I wasn't at school or doing homework was given over to training. Though I never got behind with the studies actually. Fortunately I had some amazing coaches who planned fun workouts. It's more productive that way, and I'm grateful to them for that. At the beginning I took time out to hang out with friends, but as I got more successful my routine ruled that out. But I was cool with that because swimming had become my life. How do you feel before a big race? It's what I've trained for, so I try to keep calm, get ready in good time. I go and stand by the pool a couple of events before my race with my hood up and my headphones on. Music keeps me grounded. I always do the same series of stretches because they suit my body, but I don't think about the other swimmers in the event because I can't influence what they do. It's all about my own ability. So now you've turned professional, what's that like? I love being fit and challenging myself as an athlete. Now I've left school I can concentrate on that 100%. Of course being in the public eye has its downsides, like reading stuff about yourself that's untrue. I can laugh it off, but some athletes find it hard to deal with. I do get to travel, some people would love that, but actually living out of a suitcase isn't my idea of a good time. So what's the hardest thing to deal with? Getting injured isn't fun for anyone. I've been fortunate in avoiding anything too serious, but I get the usual aches and pains. You feel miserable, but you have to stay strong. Not getting results is also tough. I talk regularly with my sports psychologists if things aren't going well, so that I don't start feeling negative about things. But there's nothing worse than competing in front of a home crowd. Their expectations are so high. Once I got really stressed out just thinking who was watching. Any advice for kids listening who'd like to follow in your footsteps? If I say, if you keep trying kids you can be like me, that sounds great doesn't it? But it can't be true for everybody. I've matured a lot recently and see things more clearly. I've given up any idea of going to college and pursuing another career for the moment, but that's my decision. I'm not saying it's the only way. In fact, what I would say is it's important to learn from your own successes and failures because only you know what you're really capable of.\n",
            "Our class is doing a butterfly survey. We're supposed to find out about them, learn their names and write down when we see them. Wow, sounds quite interesting. Yeah, there are loads around in summer with all the flowers out, not just in the countryside, but even in the middle of town they aren't hard to find. I've managed to learn what most of them are called. Some of the names in the book sound quite strange, but the tricky bits relating the name to the new one that's in front of you before it flies away. You know, matching up the colours and patterns with the picture in the book.\n",
            "I had a really exhausting weekend, went on a 10 kilometre charity walk. At least the sun was shining this time, unlike last year when it absolutely poured down apparently. That would have been really nasty. We stopped for lunch on the way, so there was no rush. My feet still hurt a bit when I'd finished, but it was worth it. Then someone from the local newspaper came to ask me loads of questions, but I would have preferred not to have been the one in the spotlight. I guess I'll get my picture published soon. I'd quite happily have given that bit a miss though, to be honest.\n",
            "When you're meeting your friends and want to tell them about something you've experienced, I'm sure you'd tell them all about it in your own words, and you certainly wouldn't need to do any research. So, for this class presentation, I'd say just pick the subject that you know most about. That way, for homework, you won't have to do very much or even any background reading. You'll be surprised at how much information you have stored in your memory. All you really need to do is make an outline to make sure you cover all the details, then practice what you're going to say using that as your guide.\n",
            "So Jason, will you have a go at the competition for young computer games designers then? It'd be really cool if I could, but I don't know if I'm really up to it. But it's for 11 to 16 year olds, so it should be your sort of thing, don't you think? It's more a question of whether I've got what it takes, really. But you know a massive amount about computer games. From the point of view of a player, yeah, absolutely. But as a designer, that's a different thing, really. I'll definitely have a closer look at the competition rules, though. I've printed them off, actually.\n",
            "In order to write a poem of your own for the school magazine, you need to prepare yourself. I'd like your views on what might help you. It might be taking it in turns to read a classic poem in front of the class each day before we start, or it could be looking at what's out there on the internet. I suggest initially everyone choosing something from this collection here. The stuff's all by people your own age, which should help you find the freedom to explore what's important to you. Your poem should try and capture life as it happens, without worrying about what others will say.\n",
            "Did you like that book I lent you? I thought the Football is Life story was inspirational. Really? I thought I knew everything about him from seeing him on TV. I had no idea he'd had such a tough childhood. Me neither. And he's really written from the heart. He's so honest about everything. It's certainly a good read, but I don't think he wrote it himself. He'll have paid somebody else to do it. Do you think so? What a letdown. I really felt like he was talking to me personally. Well, I'm sure the writer would have interviewed him, so it should be what he actually said. Yes, must be.\n",
            "Chester Zoo is celebrating the arrival of a very special creature, a rare onager foal. The male baby, who hasn't yet been named, was born to first-time mum, Zarin, last week. Onagers are related to the domestic donkey and are an Asiatic wild ass from semi-desert regions in the Middle East. These creatures are now found in just two protected areas and there are thought to be only about 400 left in existence. Chester Zoo reports that the foal is doing well. Check the zoo's website to keep up to date with how the zoo's coping with the problems of dealing with the newborn and to learn what name has been chosen for him.\n",
            "Hi, my name's Sam Conte and my job is making and selling chocolate. Later on I'm going to show you some of my chocolate. You might even get a chance to try some. But first, a bit about me. People often ask how I got into this business. Well, my parents wanted me to have a steady job, and they suggested studying something like medicine at university because they thought a job in that area would pay well, or even economics. But at the time I thought law might open more doors, so that's what I did. But life doesn't always work out the way you plan it. After finishing my degree, I took time out and went traveling in South America, where I ended up staying over a year on a cocoa plantation. I discovered that growing high-quality cocoa beans is a process that's not at all straightforward. In fact, it's a very complex one. So there's far more to the making of chocolate than first meets the eye. I had no idea, for example, how easily the cocoa beans are affected by changes in weather and climate, much more than other fruit like apples or bananas. In fact, the beans are more like grapes, really. So each year's crop is of a different quality. When I came home, I decided to open a small shop making and selling my own chocolate. That was hard work, I can tell you, because so much can go wrong with chocolate. The hardest bit is melting it in precisely the right way, but cooling it correctly isn't easy either. To learn the trade, I set about testing all the chocolate I could find. The first thing I do is break off a piece. I want to hear the snap. If it makes that noise, it means it's good. Then I smell it just before popping it into my mouth. I'll never forget the first chocolates I sold in the shop. I got such a buzz from it, and I've never lost that thrill. Another thing I like to do is write up my experiments. I keep a diary for this. It's the key to my success. One day I'll put it all on a database, but I haven't had time yet. I make a range of chocolates, but what I'm aiming for is a rich and rounded flavor without bitterness. I want top quality, but there must be a richness and only a limited sweetness. And, of course, a completely new recipe so that I can be setting a new trend. That takes time, and trying out new ideas means tasting a lot. To counter the calories, I go swimming and do a lot of running. But even then, chocolates aren't far from my mind. I actually come up with most of my strangest recipes when I'm driving. Once I've got an idea, I pick up samples and ingredients and do the cooking myself. I keep playing with flavors until I feel it's ready to try on friends. These sessions have produced some fantastic ideas, such as chili flavored chocolate, which was much more successful than anyone imagined. But I've also had my fair share of disasters, like chocolate flavored with cheese, which nobody bought. I test recipes out on my family, and they're never shy about telling me what they really think. Anyway, I've got some chocolate here for you to try. But before we do that, I'd like to show you a short video clip that shows me actually making the stuff in my laboratory. Yes, that's the name I use for the place where I work, because it is quite scientific, what I do. But it's a workshop, really, and it's located in what used to be an old sweet factory next to my house. Here it is, coming up on the screen now.\n",
            "Oh, hi, it's me, John. Sorry to miss you, you must have already left for work. Look, I wondered if you wanted to come away for the weekend. There'll be about ten of us, including someone called Sam Brent, who says he was at college with you. And he remembers that you were brilliant at rock and roll. They've decided it'll be on October the 9th, Friday night till Sunday. Anyway, I'll put the details in the post. I know you're busy at the moment, so don't feel you have to come, but just let me know one way or the other when you can. Talk to you soon. Bye.\n",
            "We spent a day exploring the shops and markets in the city and bought some souvenirs. Then we wanted to see some of the area outside the city and discovered it was easy to get to loads of places by train, including the mountains, where we were told there were great hostels. You can do bushwalks out there and apparently the scenery is stunning. But it can be dangerous. We were warned to have the right gear and tell other people where we were going, so we decided to give it a miss. Anyway, we weren't short of things to do in the city. We were spoilt for choice. We were pretty tired when we first arrived, so we were glad just to relax. We'd booked late and I have to say that the room wasn't the best I've stayed in, but we had a view of the lake, which was a real treat. We were really impressed by the forests and mountains around the city. We made good use of the swimming pool, though we were too lazy to go to the famous markets. We didn't take advantage of all the shows either. Lots of people told us how good they were, so that was a pity. And the theatres themselves were supposed to be impressive. One of my main ambitions was to see inside the big concert hall, and in fact we managed to get into a concert there, which was pretty special. The acoustics were amazing. The city was divided by a river, and getting round had its problems, especially as we didn't really understand the city plan. The best way was the ferries. I was really impressed that they were always on time and provided good views in the city. The trams were good too, and the local commuters seemed happy to chat to us and give us ideas for the best things to do and see. We didn't have time to do everything though. Before we went, we couldn't decide where to stay. So many people recommended different places, and there seemed to be loads of different and unusual possibilities, like old traditional farms converted into guest houses. So we decided to move around and try something different every couple of nights. That worked out really well, and they were all excellent. Although we'd been told that getting round on the buses was easy and cheap in the city, we decided to rent a car so that we could get out into the countryside. We didn't want to miss out on the views driving along by the ocean. Even though we had a city plan, we got lost several times, especially in the old town where the buildings were quite similar. Though I know some people say getting lost is the best way to get to know a city. We were never short of help though. Some people were even prepared to walk with us to show us the way, and that was something I'll always remember. Our hotel was alright without being spectacular, and it was a long walk into the evening shows. We took a taxi most times. There was loads to do every day though, and we certainly weren't bored.\n",
            "This evening in our series Careers with a Difference, our guest is Rachel Reed, who works for a small commercial art gallery. Rachel, welcome. Hello. Rachel, what exactly do you do? Well, there's two great things about working for a really small company. Firstly, you get to do a bit of everything. The other is that you can practically invent your job title. Mine is marketing manager, although I do a lot of other things too. It does describe the majority of what I do. So tell us about your day. Well, it all starts with the huge pile of post we get. We often get artists sending in photographs of their work to see if we'd be interested in exhibiting it. I learned very early on how to differentiate between the possibles and those which are unsuitable. But how do you tell? It might be the style, or sometimes the subject matter is just not going to look right in our gallery. But more often than not, it's just that they're not of the required standard. The possibles I pass on to the gallery manager who makes the final decision. So you have quite a lot of contact with artists? Yes. Sometimes I spend nearly all day on the phone and about 50% of the time it's artists. I send letters explaining why we can't show their work. Some of them phone up to argue about it. I find those calls very hard to deal with. Artists we do exhibit also phone to find out if we've managed to sell anything and, if we have, when the money will be coming through. I don't mind those so much. Most other calls are from clients. We have a new artist exhibiting here every two to four weeks and before the show takes place we send out a catalogue to the clients on our database. Obviously the catalogue's illustrated. Oh yes, and as soon as the catalogue goes out we start getting phone calls because people see something they like and want to reserve it. Sometimes they even buy things over the phone. The catalogue also contains a commentary about the artist which I have to write and research. I try to find out what has influenced them, where they learned to paint, what the subject matter represents, that sort of thing, but I try to avoid quoting from positive reviews of their work. It's not meant to be advertising as such. So your job is not all administrative? Compared to a typical office, that side of it's quite minimal. That's why I can cope without an assistant. There are systems in place to deal with routine jobs. For instance, I don't have to send out the catalogues. The company which prints them also prints the envelopes and posts them. Another company takes care of the food and drinks when we have the opening of a new exhibition. And are you involved in other aspects of the business? Yes. We also offer a consultancy service for large companies that want to display works of art in their offices. I phone round companies, explain what we do and, if they're interested, make an appointment for the gallery manager to go and see them. It's interesting. The companies tend to go much more for modern or abstract art than people coming to the gallery. And the best part of the job for you? The really rewarding thing for me is that you never know how a day is going to go. Some days it'll be really quiet, other days it's really busy and you don't know what you're going to have to cope with. And there's the added bonus of working with really nice people. And of course I have the pleasure of spending my days surrounded by beautiful works of art. So I can't complain. Thank you, Rachel.\n",
            "So, how did you like the new sports center? Well, there's a wide choice of things to do. It's just that their advertisement said something to suit all the family. Uh-huh. I wish they'd had water games for the under fives. There was nothing really suitable for them. But you can learn to windsurf or sail, and you have the freedom to go anywhere in the lake. Isn't that a bit dangerous? Not really. Nobody's allowed in the water without a life jacket, and a rescue boat is on hand all the time. Sounds great. It was.\n",
            "Are you ever annoyed by interviewers? Well, I'm often asked about the financial side of things. I don't mind, but I can honestly say for many tournaments, I don't even know what the prize money is. I just focus on playing to my full potential. They must find that answer disappointing. No, the ones I have a problem with are those who assume it's all about partying and gossip. I wish they'd ask about the real lifestyle. Practising day in, day out, and getting from tournament to tournament. I probably do around a hundred long-haul flights a year. It sounds exciting, but it wipes you out and actually ruins your social life.\n",
            "I've been slowly writing more and more poems for kids over the last few years. Talking to young people in schools, which I've been doing for some time now, reinforces my belief that they need and want the same range of subjects that older people do. Relationships, work, family, etc. Often it's something that only emerges after my poems are finished, but quite a few of them in my new collection were first thought of as poems for adults, until I realised that they might work just as well or better for kids. But I hope it's a book that adults will enjoy too.\n",
            "Did you watch that programme about the Gobi Desert last night? I thought it'd be really interesting because it's a part of the world I know very little about. The photography was brilliant, wasn't it? Yes. You could really feel how harsh the life was there. Overwhelmingly grey, I thought. It'd be hard to feel cheerful living in that landscape. It was a bit short on facts though, wasn't it? I don't think it was that kind of programme. They just wanted you to be amazed at the fantastic landscape. I guess that's why there wasn't much commentary. You're right. I hadn't thought of that.\n",
            "So, your first live ice hockey game. Glad you came? Well, I wouldn't have missed it for the world, but it was so cold. I had no idea that it would be like that. I wish I brought my thicker coat. That's normal. At least it was a really exciting game. Our team was doing much better than usual. Well, perhaps that accounts for the noise. I knew it would be loud, but it was incredible! What do you expect? We have to support them. Well, I can say I've done it. Just don't expect to see me here next week.\n",
            "I can see why people really rate the place. Yeah, they really know how to bring out the flavours in the different dishes. They also put a lot of thought into combining unusual ingredients. And as a restaurant it's not too stuffy and formal. It's got a really lively feel about it. Perhaps a little too lively. It was quite hard to hear each other above the din. I'm not sure it would be the place to come for a romantic dinner. Great food though, and so visually appealing on the plate. They've made a lot of effort with that. It really adds to the experience, doesn't it?\n",
            "As a result of heavy snow, there has been major disruption to rail services this morning. A number of breakdowns have been reported in the west, with people stranded on some trains. In this region, blizzard conditions are making driving conditions hazardous. A severely restricted train service will be operating within the next few hours into the capital, and delays are expected on all lines in the south of the country. In the north, there is some snow, but services have been able to continue, with only a few cancellations reported.\n",
            "Thanks for inviting me tonight. As you know, my main interest is in conservation and I'm lucky enough to work with lots of different organizations looking after animals both in captivity and in the wild. I'd been fascinated by all kinds of bears for a long time before I started working in this field, but it was the spectacled bear that really attracted me. Some people find it appealing because of its size and shape and it's less well known than other types of bear, but for me I thought it was such a great name. It comes from the patches of yellowish fur around the bear's eyes which grow in a sort of circle shape like glasses. Although these golden markings vary greatly from one bear to another and may not be limited to the eyes, they can extend as far as the bear's cheeks or even chest. I'd like to explain what we know about this bear and why I find it so fascinating. It's the only survivor of a type of bear that once ranged across America during the last Ice Age. We thought that it was only found in certain places in Venezuela and Chile, but I was thrilled to read some reports that suggested it might also be living in northern parts of Argentina and eastern Panama. It's quite difficult to find spectacled bears in the wild because they are quite shy animals and tend to live in a wide variety of habitats which can range from dry coastal deserts to high mountain areas above 4,000 meters. They are most commonly found in forests though, being such timid animals they tend to come out at night which is another thing that makes them difficult to see. Though, like me, you may be surprised to learn that they don't sleep all through the winter as many other types of bear do. We're not sure about the actual number of spectacled bears that remain in the wild but it's been estimated that there are only about 2,400 still around. The bears are endangered not so much because they are hunted by other animals but what I find really sad is the fact that humans destroy their habitat. Spectacled bears are quite small compared with other bears and of course they do have other enemies. These mostly include mountain lions and jaguars but they remain a smaller threat. The bears are primarily vegetarian and their normal diet is tree bark and berries. On rare occasions though they eat honey which I thought was just something in children's books. I was interested to find that they are incredibly good climbers and one thing I found really funny is that they've been known to sit up in a tree for days. They make a platform. Why? I couldn't guess. But they're waiting for fruit to ripen so they can eat it. It's quite surprising that although they rarely eat meat they have extremely strong jaws and wide flat teeth. Very occasionally they do eat meat, something like birds or insects though they like small mice best if they can get them. We're really trying to make people more aware of the bears and we've made a television series about one man's efforts to make people understand the dangers facing the animals. He spent a long time in Peru studying them and has published a very funny diary of his time there. I hope everyone will read it and support our efforts to help these fascinating creatures. So are there any questions?\n",
            "It's not for everyone, but I love the physical aspect. I started almost by accident. My uncle took me to an indoor climbing wall, and I was hooked. The start of any climb still gives me a real buzz. I've never settled for being less than the best at anything I've tried, and that's what pushed me to the standard I am now, which doesn't mean I don't think I can still improve. I get a huge sense of achievement when I finish a particularly demanding climb, and though other climbers get nervous sometimes, like when there's ice or the weather's bad, that never puts me off.\n",
            "What is happiness? From an early age, happiness for me is sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake on a summer's day and doing some serious fishing. All alone, just me and my thoughts. No stress, get away from it all for an hour or so. But maybe not completely aimless, not just lying on a beach somewhere, but having some task to do. Then, when it's all over, it's back to normal life and problems and hassle and having to fight to get what you want. But that brief moment of happiness helps me to reflect and make sense of my life. I think to be happy you do obviously need some financial security. Not rich, I didn't say that because there's an important difference. Also, I'd say you need humour in your life. That's kind of obvious too. Having lots of free time to do what you want. Not sure there. I'd say quite the reverse actually. For me you really appreciate your moments of leisure when you've done lots of hard work. If it's all play and no work in your life, then you don't enjoy it. So for me it's all to do with setting yourself a list of things to get through and then you've completed them, now you can be happy. I sometimes wonder if being happy is something to do with age. Very young children are happy most of the time, very old people are happy when they think of fond memories and also they're happy when they see their grandchildren happy. So happiness is not just specific to one age group, that's certainly the case with my family. But in my experience, happy people get through life more easily. If you take things seriously all the time, that's when you get stressed or have health issues maybe. And sometimes life can be a real pain, let's be honest. Happiness comes in many shapes and forms. Personally, I'm happy when I'm active, doing my sports and feeling all healthy. But maybe that's a rather self-centered view. I also get moments when I'm just, say, sitting on a train and suddenly I think of my children's smiling faces and realize how lucky I am, how happy they make me. And my husband too, of course. My life could have turned out much worse, as it has for many people. Will I still be happy when they've all grown up and gone away? I'm sure when that time comes, I'll find a new form of happiness. It's sometimes said that you make your own happiness, and I've got some sympathy for that view. But in my experience, it's something more than that. It might sound strange, but I honestly think it's all about your life not being too easy. If everything in your life is handed to you on a plate by rich parents, then I actually don't think you're as happy as someone who's had to struggle a bit in their life. When you can share your struggles with others and laugh about how you got through them, that's when you're truly happy. That's certainly how it's worked out for me.\n",
            "Today on the programme we have Mickey Smith, author of the book The Power of Practice. Mickey, in your book you talk about what makes a champion sportsperson. Your argument is that talent - a natural aptitude or skill - doesn't exist, right? Right. I know that's controversial because it's thought that people are born with natural abilities. I have my critics, but the evidence from research I've done backs up my argument. If you look at anyone who's reached a high level in any complex task, you'll find they've spent many years building up to it. This has started other people thinking and doing their own research. I've no doubt they'll reach the same conclusions I have. What about physical abilities like speed? Isn't that what makes one footballer better than another, for example? There are physical issues that are significant in some activities. However, in virtually all complex tasks, the limiting factor is a mental thing. People don't become the greatest footballers because they move around the pitch quickly. While he may not realise it, the way a great footballer understands where his teammates are around him on the field is what helps him score goals, rather than speed. In your book you also talk about geographical areas, where lots of people become experts in the same activity. Gymnastics, for example. The town I grew up in produced the top gymnasts of my generation, myself included. My initial reaction when I got to the top was, wow, I must have been born with this ability to do gymnastics. But what about the others? What I now understand is that this excellence was down to having access to a fantastic coach and a seven-day-a-week gymnastics club, where we transformed ourselves from ordinary to extraordinary. Opportunity is another factor determining success. Your argument is that to become excellent you have to practice for thousands of hours. That's a lot of training. That's right. How successful you are is down to how long you're prepared to work. Evidence suggests those who make it believe excellence relies on practice. If you believe being good at something is down to natural ability, when you fail you'll think you don't have enough of it and you're more likely to give up. If you believe excellence is about effort, when you fail you're going to see it as an opportunity to grow. What approach should coaches take when training youngsters in sport? The way to go about it is to ensure the child enjoys what they're learning, that it becomes an internal desire to progress. Coaching young people is more about psychology than it is about the technical side of things. It's making the young performer really care about where they're going, motivating them in the right way that will enable them to actually get there. Little difference from how you encourage adults really. Why don't more people who play sport try harder to improve? Well, they see sports stars and assume they were born brilliant, but there's no evidence to suggest that. You just don't see the painstaking process it took to get them there when they're winning games on your TV screen. If you did, their brilliance wouldn't seem so miraculous. The illusion is to think they got there quickly and think, oh my goodness, I could never get up that slope. Given everything you've said about top performers, why do they sometimes fail at crucial moments? That's called choking, right? Yes, it's to do with the expectation to succeed no matter how many times they've done it before. When you first practice a skill, you have to exert conscious control over it. When you become proficient, you're able to do it subconsciously. When you choke, you become so anxious that instead of delivering your skill automatically, you become conscious of what you're doing and it's like you've never done it before. Thank you very much.\n",
            "Attention everybody, this is Sonja Lee and I'm events manager for today at SeaWorld Centre. If you hurry to Zone D you can catch the spectacular Riding with Dolphins event. The next one's on at five past eleven but don't worry if you miss that because you've got three more chances to see it today. We'll now be feeding the sea lions at two fifteen, that's forty five minutes later than scheduled according to your programs and whatever you do don't miss the ever popular Penguin Walkabout that starts in half an hour.

            "I enjoyed that. It was a bit too businessy for me. I know everything's about profits these days, but I still think producing books should be more about creativity than making money. Everything's going the same way, whether you like it or not. A friend of mine did a course on book illustration and she said the first lecture was about costs. Anyway, this speaker said if we're going into the book trade, we should get practice in as many aspects as possible. I agree with that. They need an editor for the sports page on the student newspaper and I think I'll go for it.\n",
            "Well, what did you think of that film? I had mixed reactions, really. From what I'd read, I expected it to be funnier. I know what you mean. Just shows how different people's tastes can be, I guess. Good twist at the end, though. I wasn't expecting that, were you? I kinda guessed what was coming, to be honest. There were a lot of references to other films in the storyline, I thought. Oh, you think so? I wasn't quite sure what message it was trying to convey, though. One minute it seemed to be saying one thing, and the next it was saying the opposite. Yeah, I agree.\n",
            "Stephen, this new environmental project you're running, what are you hoping to achieve? Well, Suzie, the town I live in, Melbury, is a very pleasant place to live, clean and tidy. The problem really isn't with Melbury as such, but is a wider problem, that of the dangers of rubbish to wildlife. So I got all the retailers in the town together and showed them a film I'd made on this subject, and as a result they've agreed to use paper bags instead of plastic ones. Recycling was introduced very successfully last year, so I'm hoping that my new project will have similar success.\n",
            "Professional salespeople can sell anything to anyone and they do this by using very basic psychological techniques. Buyers normally have certain requirements by which they will judge the suitability of a product. The seller therefore attempts to find out what these conditions are by building a bond, asking questions about hobbies, family and the like. But you need to remember, the seller is only interested in closing the deal. At its most extreme, salespeople will even attempt to mirror the body language of the buyer. If the buyer laughs, then so will the seller.\n",
            "The college website is up again. Have you seen it? Yes, they've been working on it for a month and it's better now. I thought if they'd got sponsorship from local companies, there'd be too many advertisements. But it's OK. Yeah, that's not a problem. They must have got someone in from the design department to work on it, because there's some real improvements. It's not so dull. Especially the artwork on the home page. They want people to send in ideas so they can change the layout regularly. OK, so long as it doesn't get too complicated and you waste time figuring out how to get to the page you want.\n",
            "How did you find the competition? Tough, but I really enjoyed it. I was convinced the dishes I'd chosen to prepare would go down well. I decided to focus on using local ingredients as people nowadays worry a lot about what they're eating, and it's really important to know where the food comes from. It was my first time competing against others, and it was fun being under pressure to come up with things under strict time limits. I hadn't expected to be so worn out though. I think it was having to be on my feet for so long. But it's definitely something I'll do again.\n",
            "Hello everyone, my name is Chris Graham and I spent my last vacation working in Australia. The place I was in is a popular tourist spot so there are lots of student jobs advertised in the newspaper, from hotel work to being a tour guide. I saw my job for a bus driver on the internet and so I applied. I'd recommend you do that too. The whole idea of getting to know another country really appealed to me and I'm really pleased I had the opportunity to go. I worked for a company which tries to help tourists understand what life used to be like before Europeans arrived, a time before clothes, cars and electricity. Many of the local people, the aborigines, work for the company. Studying tourism at university wasn't essential to get the job, in fact my subject's history. What I did do was a short training course when I first arrived though to learn about the local plants and animals. At first I was given a room in a hotel in town but I found that I felt quite lonely so I moved into a caravan on the outskirts. Lots of other staff lived on the site and I got to meet lots of the local people there too. Everyone was really friendly and as there wasn't a cinema or restaurant nearby, people frequently had a party on Saturday night and I was always invited. I worked six days a week and I had to get up really early in the morning when most people, and even the birds and animals, are asleep. This is so the tourists can get to take photos of the sunrise. I used to pick them up from their hotels around 5am and then head out of town and into the desert. The tourists were from all over the world and often had no experience of the heat. They knew of course about covering their head and neck with a hat but often left their shoulders uncovered which wasn't very sensible, especially if they hadn't been in the country for long and weren't used to the sun. After we had been into the desert, I would take the tourists to the local cultural centre where they had the opportunity to ask questions. The tourists were especially keen to find out how to distinguish the tracks of kangaroos from wallabies and wild dogs. After the morning session, I usually went back home, had a shower and a rest, then started again around two in the afternoon. I used to take the afternoon group to a waterhole where they were shown which plants could be eaten and which were also used to make weapons for hunting. At one time there were very few tourists in the particular area I worked in because you needed to get a coach from the small railway station in the nearest large town a good 200 kilometres away. There's now an airport but the local government is keen to get one built which can take more flights, especially from abroad. I'm not sure about that as I think it's busy enough as it is but it would be good for the local economy, no doubt about it. Anyway, I really recommend working in Australia during your vacation. The busy tourist season in the area where I worked is from May to October so you need to make sure your application is in by the January of the year you're hoping to work. You might not hear until March as it takes a while to process the applications and get references but make sure you don't leave it too late.\n",
            "In the quest for gender equality, it feels as though every step forward is followed by two steps back. In the grip of war, global pandemics and climate change, the world has not become safer for women and girls. And the hard-won progress made by women's rights movements around the world faces a reversal. A pushback. Increasing assaults on women's right to make decisions about their own bodies. Mounting obstacles to girls' education and leadership. Rising cases of disappearances and of women being killed just for being women. Violence against women and girls, online or offline, cannot and will not go unchecked. Now's our moment to add momentum to the growing movement against violence, oppression and repression. Against the pushback, we push forward. By using our votes to elevate more women, at every level, into positions of power. By enshrining the right to freedom of choice and education. By protecting disempowered communities and advocating for survivors' rights. And by taking action to end all violence against women and girls. The only way forward is forward.\n",
            "Hey guys! My name is Asha and this video is for British Council's LearnEnglish Teens online magazine and YouTube channel. Today, I just wanted to talk about how much we are all obsessed with technology and how it is taking over our lives and I know in fact it is taking over my life - and here are some some points to see if it's taking over your life too. If you look at a screen at least nine times a day, it means you're obsessed with technology. It could be your mobile phone, your iPad, your laptop, your television, even an iPod counts. And sometimes I question why I have glasses and then I'm like, 'Duh! I'm just obsessed with looking at screens and it's just messed up my vision.' That is why I honestly think that the Kindle is such a good invention. It saves so much space around your house - but it means looking at a screen again, so I like to stick to the old-school method of turning pages. Plus I am in love with the smell of new books and old books. Ah! It just smells so good! It really is an unhealthy obsession that I have. Another sign of an obsession with technology-slash-social media is if you check it in the morning and you check it in the evening too, before you go to sleep; and if that becomes your usual routine every single day, well then... you've got a problem too! Personally, I am so guilty of this - and what makes it worse is, I will check every social media and then 'cause it's taken me 35 minutes to check through it all, I think it is long enough to go all the way back and recheck the social medias again! I really shouldn't do that. The next one is, is if you feel you can't cope if your TV broke or if your phone broke and I tell you, a sign of someone who's obsessed with their phone is hold on if you have one of these bad boys, a portable charger, it means you're obsessed with your phone because you just don't want it to die. The only thing I think I could cope with it breaking is probably my TV because I know I'll have other devices to watch TV on - so whether that's my laptop or my phone, I'm good. Just as long as my phone doesn't break! I have this really bad attachment with my phone. Lastly is if you feel like you are not up to date with your favourite celebrities. When Kim Kardashian had taken her three-month break off social media, I was actually missing her, as much as it sounds quite sad to say, but she was a frequent poster and I was a bit like, 'Where is Kim Kardashian? What is she doing with her life? Why is she not updating me?' But if you feel like you relate to any of these symptoms of being obsessed with technology or social media, well, it's all right girl, or boy, I am with you and together we will conquer this addiction. If you want to stay up to date with my new videos - make sure you comment, like, subscribe and I will see you in my next video.\n",
            "Welcome to today's show. We're very happy to have Anna Oliveira as our guest today. Anna is the creator and founder of HomeworX - spelled with an 'x' we should note - an app which helps teenagers with their homework. Thanks for coming in, Anna. Thanks for having me. So, tell us about your app. How does it work? Well, teenagers and their parents have numerous challenges when it comes to homework these days. In many families both parents work and don't have much available time to help their kids with their homework. And even if they do have time to help, they may not be able to offer support with the content. What I mean is, they may not know, or at least remember, enough in any given subject to support. You mean they might not be able to remember complex maths or might have never studied certain subjects, such as biology or economics, themselves? Exactly. So they might want to support their children with their homework, but have neither the time nor the knowledge to do so. I see. So the app helps solve this problem? Yes, and more. The next issue is that tutors can be expensive, and there may be long waiting lists for specialist tutors in the town or region you live in. Our HomeworX app brings students and tutors together online. Students can search a database of pre-approved tutors and sign up for live online support. They don't need to be in the same town or city. That sounds really great. It is. And this approach also enables us to offer the tutoring services at lower prices because there's no travelling time involved for the tutor to get to the student's home. And tutors who live in remote areas are happy to get access to more students, and be able to work from home, even at lower rates. This all sounds great. So, how did you come up with the idea? Well, as you might guess, I was one of those parents I described earlier. I really wanted to help my son with his homework, but I was either too busy with work or I didn't actually know anything about the subjects he was having difficulty with. Also, we live in an area where there aren't many tutors and the ones that are there are either very expensive or have long waiting lists. Yes. I can understand your predicament. Well, it sounds like a very useful app that is clearly meeting a need. And its popularity obviously speaks for itself. Thank you. So, do you have plans for the future? We've just secured some funding and hope to expand the range of services we offer using the app. We wish you the best of luck. Thanks again for coming in. That was Anna Oliveira, founder of the tutoring app HomeworX, which is available for both Apple and Android devices. Join us again next week for another business interview. Have a great week, everyone.\n",
            "Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this short presentation on our new product design. As you know, we've already redeveloped our 'Adventure' shampoo to make it more modern and appealing. And we've renamed it 'Adventure Tech'. Our market research established the target market as men in the 18-40 age range who like to be outdoors and also like technical gadgets, such as smartwatches, drones and things like that. We needed to create a bottle which appeals to that market. So, today, I'm happy to unveil our new bottle design. As you can see, it's designed to look like a black metal drinking flask, with some digital features printed on it. I'd like to talk you through the following three points: the key features, sizing and our timeline for production. Firstly, you'll notice it has an ergonomic design. That means it fits smoothly into your hand and can be easily opened and squeezed using one hand. And, it looks like a flask you might use when hiking outdoors. The imitation digital displays are designed to remind the user of other tech devices they may have, such as a smartwatch or smart displays in their home. I'd now like to tell you about the sizes. It comes in two sizes: the regular size and a small travel size. The travel size is the same type of design - a flask, also with imitation digital displays on the bottle. We were thinking of starting with one and following with the travel-size in a few months, but we've worked hard and both are ready now. Finally, I'm going to talk to you about our timeline for production. You've probably heard that we're launching in two months. In preparation for that, we're starting the marketing campaign next month. You can see the complete overview of all phases in this Gantt chart. In summary, the bottle's been designed for men who like adventure and technology, and it comes in two sizes. The marketing campaign is starting next month and we're launching the product in two months. OK. So, any questions? Feel free to also email me for further information in case we run out of time.\n",
            "So, we're back in the studio. Welcome back, everyone. My name's Rick Walker. From our laptops to our televisions, from the displays on our smartphones to those on our satnavs, we are in front of screens all the time. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to disconnect completely? To choose not to have access to the internet? If you have, you may be in need of a digital detox - a total switch-off from all things digital. The idea of people taking a digital detox is becoming more and more popular, especially amongst young people - and today we're joined by someone who's tried a number of digital detox activities and is here to give us some advice about it. Amanda Vince, welcome to the studio. Thank you very much. So, Amanda, you work for a fashion magazine in London, right? I guess your work means you need to be online a lot. Oh, yes. Apart from the hundreds of emails I get every day, I'm always browsing fashion websites, as well as online videos. I also need to be very active online, especially on Twitter and Instagram - sharing what we're doing in the magazine, interacting with designers, photographers, influencers it never stops, literally. Then of course there's my friends and family to keep in touch with online too, and for me, my work grew out of my passion, so friends and work colleagues aren't two totally separate groups of people and it all gets a bit messy online sometimes. I think I'm online for at least 12 hours a day. So, how did you get the idea for a digital detox? I read a book about it, called Log off: How to Stay Connected after Disconnecting. The author's name is Blake Snow. That book gave me some really good advice and made me think about trying to change some of my digital habits. I started with removing distraction. What do you mean by that? That means turning off alerts, buzzes, alarms or notifications of any kind. I had notifications set up for everything, and it meant I was always being forced to look at my phone. Removing all of them except for important contacts helped me focus immediately. The book also made a really good point, that we should ask ourselves 'Why?' every time we take out our phone. I realised that most of the times I looked at my phone were because I was trying to avoid or ignore something else happening right in front of me. It was an automatic habit. I have to confess, that happens to me too. But what else are you going to do when you're standing in line at the bank or waiting for your train? OK, yes, I'm the first to admit that it's great for helping time go by. But speaking personally, I found I wasn't just checking my phone to kill time when I was alone. I was also doing it with friends or family around. Hmmm right. Well, so far, this doesn't sound too drastic. Turning off notifications and becoming aware of when we use our devices. That sounds easy. Yes, it's the first step. Once we begin to realise just how much of a grip our devices have on us, then we're ready to really take the next step. First, my partner and I did a weekend with absolutely no screens. She found it easier than I did. For me, it was a little bit scary at first but it turned out to be a pretty rewarding experience. A whole weekend, huh? I don't know if I could... I think everyone has to do this at their own pace. If a weekend feels too much, maybe just try for an evening. Then work your way up to more. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you'll want to try it again. We're going to try for a whole week in the summer. OK, let's pause there then and see what our listeners have to say. You can call us here directly, or send us a message on any of our social media channels... oops, should I be saying that? Anyway, more after the break.\n",
            "In today's lecture we're going to be talking about experiments, and I thought it might be interesting for you all to learn about the world's oldest continuously running laboratory experiment that is still going today. In fact, it holds the Guinness World Record for being the longest-running experiment. This experiment began in 1927 and has been going ever since. It's called the 'pitch drop' experiment and it was created by Professor Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, Australia. Parnell was the university's first physics professor, and he wanted to show in this experiment that everyday materials, such as pitch, can have quite surprising properties. You see, when pitch is at room temperature, it feels solid. You can easily break it with a hammer. However, it isn't in fact solid. At room temperature, pitch is many billions of times more viscous than water, but it's actually fluid. In 1927, Professor Parnell took a sample of pitch. He heated it and poured it into a glass funnel. He allowed the pitch to cool and settle - for three years. He then turned the funnel upside down and cut the top off it. Since then, the pitch has slowly dropped out of the funnel. How slowly? Well, the first drop took eight years to fall. It took another forty years for another five drops to fall. Today it's been almost 90 years since the experiment started. Only nine drops have fallen from the funnel. The last drop fell in April 2014 and the next one is expected to fall in the 2020s. The experiment has a tragic story associated with it. Professor Parnell died without seeing a pitch drop. His replacement, Professor John Mainstone, became responsible for the pitch drop experiment from 1961. He held the job for 52 years, and missed seeing the drop fall three times - by a day in 1977, by just five minutes in 1988 and finally in 2000, when the webcam that was recording the experiment suffered a power outage for 20 minutes, during which time the pitch dropped. The pitch drop experiment is something we can all participate in now. There's a live web stream that allows anyone to watch the glass funnel and wait for the fateful moment. A similar experiment to the Queensland pitch drop was set up in Dublin, and the video of the moment the pitch actually dropped went viral on the internet. It's interesting to see how a very slow event can spread news so quickly.B2_a_lecture_about_an_experiment\n",
            "So, we think we know how to motivate people, right? Offer them a reward. Do this and you'll get this. Do this faster, earn more money. Do this better than everyone else, here's a promotion. We offer incentives when we want people to do things. We do it at work, at school, even at home with our kids. Tidy your room and you can watch TV. But when social psychologists test whether incentives work, they get surprising results. Sam Glucksberg, from Princeton University, America, set people a problem to solve and told them he was going to time them to see how long they took. Then he put them in two groups. He offered one group a reward for finishing fast. Five dollars for anyone finishing in the top 25 per cent and 20 dollars for the person who finished the fastest of all. To the other group he offered no incentive, but he told them he was going to use their times to calculate an average time. The first group, the ones with the reward, solved the problem faster, you'd think, right? Well, no, they actually took three and a half minutes longer than the group who just thought they were being timed. Incentive didn't work. In fact, it made them slower. This experiment has been repeated, with the same results, many times. But in business we still offer bonuses, promotions and rewards to staff. That's fine if we want them to do something simple, like chop wood. We'll pay you more if you chop the wood faster. An incentive works then. But if we want someone to do something complex, something creative, something where they have to think, rewards don't work. They might even have the opposite result, and make people perform worse. Another study, by Dan Ariely, showed that the bigger the reward, the worse the subjects performed on a complex task. The reward made them focus so hard on the result that they couldn't think creatively any more. And this all matters because more and more simple jobs will become automated. We'll be left with creative, problem-solving jobs that computers will never do. And we need to find a way to motivate people to do those jobs when we've proved the traditional incentives don't work. So what does work? Giving your workers freedom; freedom to work on the things they want to work on, freedom to choose when, where and how they work. Want to work from home three days a week, get up late and work into the night instead? Fine. Just do the job well. And evidence shows people who choose the way they work get results. Companies that give employees time during the week to work on things that interest them and are not part of their regular job achieve amazing things. Some of the big tech companies are good examples of this, with ping-pong tables and areas to relax in\n",
            "I want to talk about beating stress today. You know, life here in Hong Kong is very stressful so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone because we can do something about it, just to cope with the stress. So maybe you have some change in your life, maybe big change and small change, but instead of being afraid, I think you should have a positive attitude and think of change as a normal part of life. And I think maybe here in Hong Kong, the family are crowded into a very small housing space, so maybe you would sometimes argue with your family and I think try to resolve the disagreement with people is very important because then you can build strong relationships and keep commitments you have made. For example, sometimes maybe you are feeling alone and you want to make some comfort and I think you can ask the people you trust for help is very important because if you have a bunch of friends, they can listen to you, then you can release some stress through talking to them. And do you know that actually I find a very funny thing that if you want to reduce some stress, you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S, that's 'stress'. How about, let's begin with the 'S'. Well, I think 'S' is that you can have the 'scheduling', for example you don't have to schedule too many things in your day and if you feel you are too busy, you can cut out an activity or two. And how about the 'T' word? The 'T' word is 'treat your body well', because experts say that exercise can reduce stress and also if you eat healthy food, then your brain and your body get the nourishment they need. And the word is 'R' the next word is 'R' - 'R' is very important, it says 'relax'. You can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you, maybe you can read a good book or learn a new hobby and spend time with your pet or even you can visiting a spa and that could make a very good difference. And for me, I like to play piano when I feel stressed and sometimes I may just watch some movie that make me laughs a lot. And the next word is 'E' - 'E' is about expectations, and I think be realistic about yourself is to true to yourself and others. So you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect and don't expect others to be too because that will release and reduce a lot of stress for you and the people around you. And the next word is 'S' - 'S' is, stands for 'sleep' and I really, really love to sleep, to be honest. That's my hobby, I think, because sleep if you get a good night's sleep, then it will keep your mind and your body in shape. And experts say if you sleep more than seven hours, you will actually get tired, so don't sleep too much in the day, just sleep it when you feel enough. And the last word is 'S' again. I always do this action, the 'S' word is 'smile' - if you smile and have confidence, your attitude and your thoughts influence the way you see things. And if you are a negative person, you can actually learn to think in a more positive way because that makes you feel more comfortable when you are coping with the stress. Finally I think we should take action and applies these tips to your life, so everyone can beat stress.\n",
            "Ruby, Happy World Vegan Day! I made you this cake. Thanks, Johnno. It's, um, definitely vegan. Vegans can be hard to cook for. Like vegetarians, they don't eat meat. But they also rule out other animal products, like eggs, milk and sometimes even honey. There are different reasons people choose to be vegan, like animal welfare or as a way to eat healthier. But there's another reason that's been getting a lot of attention recently. Last month, a big study came out looking into the effect our food has on the environment. And it found that eating less meat is one of the most important things we can do to help the planet. You see, a huge amount of the earth's resources go into raising livestock for meat. In some places, forests are cleared to make space for animals and to grow their food. They also use a lot of water. And these ones in particular create a lot of carbon emissions. Cow burps and farts account for about 16 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The study says, to prevent permanent damage to our planet, the average world citizen needs to eat 75 per cent less beef, 90 per cent less pork and 50 per cent fewer eggs. Of course, not everyone's going to go vegan or give up eating meat completely. But swapping your beef for beans or your chicken for chickpeas every so often might not be such a bad idea. All right, Johnno, try this. Mmm. This is vegan? Yeah. It's not all rabbit food.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Tillie and I'm from Leeds, which is in the north of England. I am half Ghanaian. This is my Ghanaian dad... Tillie's dad: Her father. and I am half English. This is my English mum. Tillie's mum: Hello! Having two parents from different countries is really cool because you get to go on holiday a lot. Er, and also you get to experience two different cultures and, kind of, create your own culture, 'cause you get to mix them both together. Being mixed, I did realise I was different. For example, at the age of seven, it was a PE day, a normal day, I had my hair down and it was drying at its, like, full capacity. It was very big. We got changed in the cloakroom. Everybody was excited to do PE. So was I. Some girls had their hair down, some had earrings in, some had it up, and I remember being asked by a teacher, 'Can you tie your hair up, please, Tillie?' So the teacher give me a very, very tiny hairband. I just remember saying, 'I can't do that.' So I then got in trouble for not being able to tie my hair up and having to miss PE, which was one of my favourite lessons. And I had to sit on a hill and watch everyone else play PE, like I'd done something wrong, like I was bad for having big hair. And feeling really, really sad. I remember being at primary school and having another friend that was mixed race and her being a slightly darker skin tone to me, and constantly having to justify that I'm mixed race too. People wouldn't believe me, and it still happens now. My complexion is naturally quite lighter anyway. Everyone comes in different skin tones. In terms of food, I love to eat English and Ghanaian food. But these are some of the Ghanaian foods that I like to eat. There is some plantain here, but these are actually the chip form, the crisp form, which are really good. Um, and also there's some chin chin here, which I absolutely love. And one thing that's fun to make in the kitchen is, er, fufu. That's always good. Er, fufu is an instant plantain. You dip in, er, a sauce and it's like, kind of a doughy texture and it's really nice with your food. I remember my first trip to Ghana, walking down Jamestown, where my grandad's originally from, and seeing lots and lots of magical things. Goats roaming the streets, dogs roaming the streets, children playing, music You never see a goat walking down the street in Leeds. In England a lot of people know me as Tillie, but my Ghanaian name and birth name is Amatillie. And when I got to Ghana I instantly felt welcome when there's about five Amatillies walking down the street. Having parents from different cultures definitely means a lot to me. The problems that I thought were a problem when I was six, for example, have definitely changed. I feel like I've accepted that I've got big hair and it's made me tougher and stronger and want to embrace where I'm from even more.\n",
            "Black History Month. Let's start from the beginning and find out who created it. Well, a black man born in the US in 1875, named Carter G Woodson, studied history throughout his life, and he worked hard to promote black history in schools. He then created Black History Week, which then turned into a whole month. It was originally founded to recognise the contributions of people from African and Caribbean backgrounds. In the United States it's in February, but in the UK it's in October. You may be thinking, Why isn't there a history month for other races and ethnicities? Well, there is an East and South East Asian Heritage Month, but they're perhaps not as widely known as Black History Month, and when it comes to other races, while they don't all have an official history month that's been formally recognised, they do celebrate their history in lots of other ways. So why is Black History Month important? Let me explain. Black people have lived in the UK for hundreds of years and play a key part in British history. However, some people believe that their stories have not always been told and can often be overlooked. Many campaigners want schools to include more black history and lessons, so Black History Month is a time to celebrate those people and their stories. So now we know who created it and why, but how do people celebrate it? There's a few, so I need a deep breath! School fairs, learning about black history, awards, TV shows, reading books by black authors, cooking events, supporting black businesses, attending black history events, donating to charities and many, many more! Now you're all set, but don't mind me. I just need to go and catch my breath.\n",
            "The internet is full of articles about what makes a good boy band. But many bands appear and disappear without a trace. Alana, it can't be as easy as following a formula, can it? No, I don't think so. The traditional formula is that you have four or five good-looking young guys with some musical ability and the ability to dance - the choreographed dancing was very important to boy bands in the past. They tended to wear the same, or very similar clothes when they performed, so you had to decide on a 'look' for the group. The most important element, however, was said to be that the band members had different and very distinct personalities. Right, the cute one, the rebel, the joker, the shy one, mysterious one... Yeah, although sometimes they all just seem to like the cute one! The idea is that different boys appeal to different girls, so you can have a bigger fan base. There's someone in the band for everyone. So, do you think this all still holds true? Or have things changed in the 21st century? Yeah, I guess things have changed for several reasons - partly just because we needed a change - but mainly because of changes in the media and with new technology. Take One Direction Ah, I've been counting the seconds before you mentioned One Direction! Well, we have to talk about them because they're the biggest thing at the moment, although who knows how long they will last. Oh, ages and ages... We'll see. Anyway, One Direction, as you know, came to fame through the X Factor, a reality show, and that was a great way to start. You had loads of people watching them every week and wanting them to win. They felt as if they had a personal stake in their story as they voted for them every week. What age group does One Direction appeal to exactly? That's another clever thing, they seem very unthreatening, so they appeal to very young girls, they are cute so teenage girls really like them, but they also have a laddish, slightly naughty side to appeal to the mums! The teenage girls and the mums are the ones who will spend money. The lyrics to the songs are calculated to appeal to girls who feel a bit insecure about themselves, like most teenage girls. 'You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful', that kind of thing. Lots of girls want to feel wanted, but not scared, and that's traditionally what boy bands do. They present this image of a clean-cut, reliable boyfriend. Actually, One Direction's clothes help here: also chinos and clean casual shirts and canvas shoes. You'll have noticed that they don't wear the same clothes. Their stylists have been instructed to keep them looking individual, but despite that they all have this attractive but unthreatening look. No tattoos, or piercings, or black leather, or make-up or anything. You make them seem very cold and calculating. Remember that they've been nominated for loads of music awards and they've won dozens, so they're regarded as serious musicians. OK, if you don't want to believe they're calculating you can blame their management. They're nice boys who are fantastic musicians. They are! And they keep proving their critics wrong. A lot of people said they wouldn't make the leap from the UK to the US market, but they did very quickly. Yes, and that's all down to their clever use of social media, or rather their management's clever use of social media. One Direction are all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. That's how they made it in the States so quickly. In the past it was a lot more difficult and took a lot longer. Bands had to try and get air-time on local radio stations and that was really hard. But they've by-passed all that. Social media has become the new radio, as their manager said. Their first record, Up All Night, went to number one in the US, didn't it? Sure did! They achieved a world record as the first British band in history to reach number one in America with a debut album. It sold 176,000 copies in the US in a single week. Amazing. And the boys are all rich from the merchandising too. Yes, well, the boys and their management company. There are One Direction phones, toys and games. Dolls, even. I think that's another 21st-century thing - companies are cashing in on success in all possible ways as quickly as possible. May they all enjoy it while it lasts.\n",
            "'Break the bias' means it's time to question our own minds. Bias may be natural, but it also may be an excuse. Bias can be broken - gender bias must be broken - because it leads to hate, it leads to violence, it leads to cages. We yelling break the bias Why does my gender mean that I should just be quiet? Oh no I'm not with it And I don't buy it Let's all be equal in these spaces We should try it Let's break the bias We yelling break the bias Women are beautiful and still as strong as lions Discrimination Don't support it, don't supply it Don't you see the value If you don't know how to Here's a start Let's break the bias Gender bias Stop that stuff When they run it by us Stereotypes Things I don't like Gets real bad when you multiply it We just wanna be equal All this hate is real lethal Bias at work Bias at home We can't stop till the bias all gone We're innovators, educators Used to fight to be seen Taught to be timid and weak Cross our legs and soften our speech But normal doesn't mean right And right is always subjective So what was OK then Isn't that now We modified the objective The bias, it starts in the mind We gotta focus on changing These are new rules that we're laying Just because I'm a woman My only worth isn't cooking and cleaning My only job isn't being a wife It's time for us to get it all right Break it clean Undo everything Watch it unravel at the seams There is so much hope For everything that we could be But gender bias stopping us from all being free Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the truth Hey, you know what I mean They want us to sit down and shut up But we got plans to rise up We're all in this together And hate can't spread forever So just imagine Break the bias We'll be so much better If we could even out the score Fix it from the core No more wanting to be equal Don't have to fight it any more We have to understand exactly what we're doing this for A better world A better life And everything that's in store You don't know me because of how I look, what I wear, how I sound, where I live.

            "Writing - it helps us perform all sorts of activities every day. It's easy to assume that writing's always been around. But like most things, it had to be invented. Have you ever written something down so you can remember it later on? Maybe you hear a good song on the radio and you decide to write it down on a piece of paper. Or, perhaps you're going shopping and you decide to write a shopping list. Well, in a sort of similar way, this is why people started to write thousands of years ago. The earliest examples of writing are probably on clay tablets like these, written with the script cuneiform. They were made in the Middle East, in what is now Iraq, about five thousand years ago. If you were a leader of a big old city, you'd probably want to keep track of what's going on, so you're going to write things down like how much money you've given people, or how much stuff you've got in storage. Well, this tablet here does just that. It's a record of all the beer rations given to workers. And, look here - this is somebody drinking some beer. Tell you what, I bet my dad would like to get paid in beer! One of the most famous types of ancient writing is of course hieroglyphs, used by the Egyptians thousands of years ago. Like other early forms of writing, hieroglyphs look like pictures, but they're actually mostly signs that represent the sounds of the Egyptian language. I'm going to meet a modern-day scribe to find out how they did it. Hello Paul! How are you doing? Good. Thank you very much for letting me come to your studio. Could you show me through what you've got here? So, this is papyrus, and I have a selection of different tools used for writing: reeds, woody reeds, bamboo, quills and rushes, which is what we're going to use for writing. And is this what they wrote with, back in Egypt? Possibly. What I'll do is I'll just dip some, some of this ink here, and, uhm, hold the tool vertically. What that does is it gives you a nice edge to Oh, wow! Do you think I can make one with you? Yes. So, a few things to remember: keep the rush vertical, and very lightly, don't squeeze it, and gently write on the Let it flow. Yes. OK. Alright, here we go oh my goodness! Ha ha! It's really big! What's happening there? This is a set up! Alright, OK I blame my tools. So, what, what are you thinking, Paul? Do you think I'd make a good scribe? I think you should quit while you are ahead! Some types of writing have become forgotten over time and can no longer be read. No one knows what's written on these small stone seals. They come from a great ancient civilisation that existed about three thousand five hundred years ago in the Indus valley, in what is now known as India and Pakistan. I wonder what they say. Another type of script in use across the world today is Arabic, like this example we have here. Now, Arabic is the language of the Islamic holy book, the Quran, and unlike what you might be used to, Arabic reads from right to left. One thing about Arabic is that it can be very beautiful, and artists have used it for hundreds of years to make paintings, to cover objects in words and to decorate buildings, like these tiles from Iran used in mosques, palaces and shrines. Did you know the oldest type of writing still in use today is Chinese? It's thousands of years old. Because we can understand written messages from the past, we can often read about things that were never intended to be seen by others, like these Roman tablets found in the north of England. Some of them are just personal notes, like an invite to a birthday party, or announcing the delivery of some socks and pants. The amazing thing about writing is it's allowed humans to do something quite special, and that is to record different ideas, events and messages and emotions without having somebody to be physically there to communicate them. And, like the messages we can read from the past, perhaps what you write today could also be read in hundreds or thousands of years' time in the future. Eh? Unknown error? What? You must restart your computer? Oh, I can't believe it!\n",
            "Hi, everyone! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today I'm joined with Natasha again and we are going to be doing a little challenge. I've seen this video on YouTube and it's an accent challenge. So, Natasha, where are you from?Natasha: Er, I'm from the US, in California.Sophia: And I'm from London, in England in the UK. As you might be able to already tell, our accents are slightly different, so even though we are both English native speakers, we pronounce some words differently. So, we wanted to put this to the test and see how we pronounce words differently. So, we have a list of words that we're going to both pronounce and you guys can join in as well. Before we say how we would say these words, you can tell us how you would say them. So, the first word is this - hopefully the sun is not washing it out. How would you pronounce that? Natasha, do you want to go first?Natasha: 'Vitamin.'Sophia: You would say 'vitamin'. I would say 'vitamin'. Why do you pronounce your 'Vs' as 'vai'?Natasha: Well, it's 'V-I', is why it's 'vai' for us.Sophia: 'V', 'vitamin' 'vitamin' anyway, that's the difference! I'm not sure about the technicality behind it. next word is a basic for everyone but we argue about how we pronounce it. How would you guys pronounce this? How would you say it?Natasha: I would say 'water'.Sophia: And I would say 'water'. I think the British, like, ooh, at least the London British accent, is very closed in the mouth, it's like 'wa' like everything is... swallowed.Natasha: That's true. Yeah, and I think in the US we don't, well, just at least where I'm from, we don't always pronounce the 'T' super sharply so it becomes like a 'D' sound, like 'butter', too, is also, how do you say 'butter'?Sophia: 'Butter.'Natasha: Yeah. So, I think it tends to have a 'D' sound.Sophia: Mm, OK, that's interesting. OK, the next one is this. So, I would say 'herb'.Natasha: And I would say 'erb'.Sophia: Why do you not pronounce the 'H'?Natasha: I don't know. That's a really good question. I'm not sure, but I've always loved 'herb'. Like, I've always wanted to name someone 'Herb'. But I don't know why we don't pronounce the 'H'. That's a very good question.Sophia: I was actually watching another YouTube video recently and apparently the 'haitch' in the British English phonetic alphabet is actually meant to be 'aitch'.Natasha: Oh. And that's how we say it in the US. We say 'aitch'. We don't say 'haitch'.Sophia: But I always thought that was wrong. So, I guess I've been saying the 'haitch' wrong all these years. And the last word is Oh my god! And the last one is this. I would say this 'envelope'.Natasha: I would say 'envelope'.Sophia: Yeah.Natasha: But actually sometimes I think I say 'envelope'.Sophia: 'Envelope.' But why do you say 'en'? That sounds French.Natasha: Yeah, it does sound French. 'Envelope.' I'm not sure.Sophia: 'Envelope.'Natasha: I don't know why we say the things that we do.Sophia: So, I hope you guys have enjoyed this video anyway. Comment below, let us know is this, is this a mean question to ask whose accent they prefer?Natasha: Ha ha. I don't think it's that mean.Sophia: Be nice! But let us know which accent you prefer, which one perhaps is clearer. Or if you can even hear any differences, because I know some people don't always hear the differences between different native speakers. But I hope you enjoy this video and I hope you guys are having a great day. We'll see you in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "The first item in the news today is the recent elections that took place across the country. This was a crucial vote, which may see a dramatic change in how the country develops over the coming years. Overall, a 54.5 per cent voter turnout was registered. This represents an increase of 11 per cent over the previous election and six per cent above the average for the past 50 years. There has also been a slight change in demographics, with an increase in youth turnout in the 18- to 24- and 24- to 29-year-old brackets. Despite this increase, young people are still less likely to vote than older people; 84 per cent of voters in the 70 plus age group came to the polling stations. Moving on, the global digital powerhouse ONK today posted quarterly results which were above forecast. Back in March, Tim Bolling, CEO, issued a profit warning over fears that there would be losses following the recall of their leading product, the 40d device. In fact, the company posted quarterly revenue of US$14.8 billion which represents an increase of 11 per cent from the same quarter a year ago. They also announced that they had sold 21 million 40d devices over the quarter. The company has provided the information that with this level of revenue, there will be a gross margin of 34 to 35 per cent, ultimately leading to a US$1.20 per share cash dividend awarded to shareholders. And in our final news item we ask, will we soon be saying goodbye to coins and notes forever? The nationwide trend of using cashless payment options is increasing. There are a number of reasons for this development. A key reason for this is a growing interest in reducing the number of items people need to leave their homes with. As almost everyone carries a smartphone with them, and many people also have smartwatches, the ability to pay for things using one of these two technologies is particularly appealing. More and more retailers are accepting cashless payments and in some cases they've stopped accepting cash altogether.\n",

            "It was just so embarrassing, the whole thing. I mean, being late's one thing, and I had already got my secretary to phone through and leave a message to say I was running being schedule. But in the end I didn't get there at all, and all the other managers were there to see the team show the project and its results. Oh well, that's how it goes, I guess, Well, I'm certainly not going to forget that in a hurry! What a terrible mistake, It made the whole meeting pointless, really. I can't imagine what they thought of me, sitting there with the paperwork for another client. Very unprofessional. I mean, I could still tell them the relevant facts, but I couldn't show them the actual contract. I didn't put it in my briefcase last night. What a lost opportunity. I should've made a proper note in my diary where I would have seen it instead of just on the back of an old envelope. Anyway, it's too late now. I just didn't remember and that's that. They'll have given the work to someone else by now, I'd promised to ring before midday if I was available. I really need to be better organised. I was so busy preparing all the equipment for the presentation that I didn't notice the time passing. So then I asked reception to call me a taxi, I was still checking the papers when they rang to say it had arrived, but I couldn't believe it when he didn't know where the street was and drove all over the place, they'd already started without me by the time I finally got there. Well, I thought it was a bit strange at the time, but I just took down what I thought I heard on the machine, and then made out the order form accordingly. It wasn't till they called back to query the quantity that we realised just what I'd done. Still, we sorted it out before it was too late so it wasn't a disaster, after all.\n",
            "I guess the main weakness is with the image of some of the products. I complained about this last year. With our present strategy, we could find ourselves having problems in the future. We need to turn the situation around, work the market to our advantage. What I'd suggest is a complete review of the way we're approaching the market. I think we should get everyone together and explore all the possibilities. I'm very glad that you can come. I was worried that the invitations were so late that many key people wouldn't be able to make it. We do need your input - your information is important. I understand you're planning to come by train. The train service can be a bit of a problem, but if you go to Medford Central Station, it's a direct line. That'll take you to Tower Square - and if you give us a call when you arrive we'll send someone to collect you. When I first read the report, I was very disappointed. Our results are well below target, in spite of using the consultants, and all the new strategies we've been applying. I can't understand it at all. In order to try and get clear what's going on, I'm going to need input from various sections. What I'd like from you, as soon as you can, is price comparisons for the different regions. I'll also need a report on how useful the consultants' advice was. No, I mean they've given me everything I asked for, so I can't really complain about that. They even invited me to come over and check the figures for myself. But I'd rather try to go through them here with you, if you could spare the time. Perhaps you could tell me what you think would be the best thing to do. I'd be really interested in your views. Your experience means you must have dealt with this type of problem before. I just thought I ought to let you know, that following the discussion we had last week about staffing levels, I took your recommendation to the Board. You've probably heard already that we agreed that we do need to create a new Area Manager's position. I just wanted to let you know officially that it had been authorised. So now we can contact the recruitment agency and ask them to start looking around. They might have somebody on their books already.\n",
            "Good evening and welcome to Business People. We are fortunate to have as our guest tonight José Martínez, the founder and Director of Pizza Rapida. José was brought up in America and started his working life there. Now he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Europe. How did he achieve this? Well, he began his rise to success in Europe when he launched his pizza delivery chain from a small shop in the Spanish capital, Madrid, 10 years ago. By the late-nineties he had succeeded in expanding the business to over 400 outlets and in doing so, he has almost transformed the eating habits of the nation. As a result of this success, he has recently been able to buy out his main competitor and today, Pizza Rapida is well-known for producing top-quality food at reasonable prices. José is now one of the wealthiest men in Spain. José, welcome to our studio. Thank you. Now, did you do lots of market research before you set up your pizza delivery service? Well, not really. But I did do some basic research to get the product itself right by giving some away to teenagers in the neighbourhood. I kept experimenting with the key ingredients until they all thought the pizzas were great. But surely Spain isn't traditionally a fast food market, so why did you think a pizza home delivery service would be successful? Well, I just thought that the same trends which had caused the fast-food revolution in the US were at work in Spain. For example, more and more women were joining the labour market, leaving them less time to shop and cook, so families were beginning to think of fast food as an attractive alternative to home cooking. The sector grew incredibly quickly in the first few years. It's a little steadier now - still very healthy though. Great! So you must need an increasing number of staff - but what do you look for in your managers? I try to follow the American system and make sure my people get experience at all levels of the business. I don't want managers to come straight from university to the office without doing the basic jobs in the company first. Pizza Rapida was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1998. Was that a success, too? Yes, it was amazing! Why do you think Pizza Rapida attracted so much investment? I think initially it was largely because the basic theory of home delivery pizzas was new, easy for the general public to understand, and fun. Once we were established, the shares started to take off. And I'm happy to say that we've been the best performer on the stock market for two years and profits were up again by 45% last year. What background did you have, or training, to lead to this amazing success? Sales basically. I started my working life as a salesman for a soap company in America. After the initial three month training period, I managed to exceed the annual target they had given me, but I was so disgusted by the tiny bonus I was offered that I resigned and joined a competitor. Ten years later, they sent me to Spain to run their sales and marketing operation. Does any aspect of the Spanish lifestyle help you to promote your products? Well, Spaniards are very keen on football, as you know, and I think you have to be constantly aware of all possible opportunities. So now, when top teams are playing, I hire extra staff to deliver pizzas for the fans to eat while they watch the match on television. That sounds like a real winner! And what's next? Well, one option I was looking at was franchising the operation but I decided I didn't want to lose control, so what I'm seriously considering now is producing frozen pizzas and other food to sell to supermarket and restaurant chains. Well, I wish you every success with that and many thanks ....\n",
            "Good morning. Hills PC Supplies. Yes, hello. I want to speak to David Hills I'm afraid he's away today. Can I take a message? Well, ok. Tell him it's James Firth, from Allen and Brown. Certainly. I'm really not happy at all. We ordered a laser printer from you last month and, Let me just find the reference on that,ah yes, HPC02345, on the twelfth of March, Yes. Now, the first problem was the delivery. It came several days after you promised. I don't see why you use a despatch company if that's what happens. Oh dear. No. And then, when we took it out of the box, we found you'd sent the thing without any cables, so we couldn't even connect it up. If you think we're going to pay this invoice in full, Well, I am sorry, Mr Firth. I'll check what went wrong and I'll ask David to ring you. I'm sure he'll want to talk about a discount.

            "Hello. Thank you for calling the Jefferson recruitment line. Here are details of our current job vacancies. First of all, we are looking for a manufacturing administrator to join a team led by the plant manager. This role involves monitoring all aspects of the production process, and will include some project work. For this position you should have some relevant experience and a recognised qualification in business administration would be an advantage. You need to be a good organiser, with excellent administrative skills. A high level of computer skills is essential. You must be able to work without supervision, and must be flexible when working with others, as the position supports other managers. You should be able to work to tight deadlines. The hours are 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. The salary will be negotiable. In addition we offer a benefits package including subsidised lunches, 23 days' holiday and health insurance.\n",
            "Morning George. You know the AGM is taking place soon? Well, I'd like you to give a presentation. Oh, OK. What would you like me to talk about? I'll make some notes. Well, I'm going to talk about the engineering department and I'd like you to cover the production department. You're familiar with that side of things. Are there any particular points I should bring up? Yes, you could outline the challenges we've faced, though I don't want you to sound too negative. For example, making sure we always have the correct volume of raw materials in stock. That hasn't been easy. No indeed. And the other matter we've had to deal with is the rapid increase in energy costs, though I know all manufacturing companies have the same problem. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about maintenance costs on the new building. Yes, that's true. Then I thought you could end on a positive note. You can present our half-year results, with graphs showing our performance against competitors. They're very encouraging. OK. Sounds good.\n",
            "It can be difficult to identify management potential. I've made a number of costly mistakes myself so now I try not to make a final commitment too quickly. You should find a project to put the person you're considering in charge of for a while. Then you can observe them to see whether they really do have the qualities you're looking for. If they turn out not to be as good at, say, managing people as you'd hoped, then it's not too serious. When you're considering someone for promotion, it's important to bear in mind that different qualities are required of a line manager. For example, a manager has to work well under pressure. Moreover, he or she might at some point be called on to demonstrate loyalty to the company even if they privately have some doubts about policy. So, it pays to think carefully about what exactly your company needs for a particular management position and then you can decide whether any individual fits the profile. I once appointed a Sales Manager who I thought would be excellent. She'd proved her loyalty to the business. She'd keep her cool when things got stressful and she had a good relationship with colleagues at all levels. But it didn't work out and she handed in her notice, because she realised that her new role wouldn't give her what she ultimately wanted from her working life. So I'd say try to ensure in advance that this sort of incompatibility won't arise. Some managers say that what you hear round the water-cooler will provide you with the most useful information possible about who to promote to a managerial role. You can learn how people respond to pressure or how they get on with their peers. But I feel sceptical about this and prefer to base my judgement on more impartial measurements of a person's competencies and characteristics. That's got to be more reliable than a bit of gossip. It's obviously the case that people will try to make a good impression on you because you're their manager. So you may not always have a clear picture of what someone is really like. Some people say that the best way round this is to conduct a series of objective tests - you can find some ideas on the web - but I'm inclined to feel that you can't beat talking to other members of staff, especially the people who work closely with someone on a daily basis.\n",
            "I think whatever tools you use to record customers' details, you have to make sure you keep the data as accurate as possible. There's no point in trying to target your communications to customers' out-of-date contact details. Also, having their details wrongly recorded can annoy a customer so much that you lose their business completely. And of course, the company can't make informed decisions if they have an incomplete picture of their customers. We've spent a lot on managing our interactions with clients, and we've tried different ways of obtaining customer information. One manager even tried giving her team the target of calling every customer individually to get opinions on a new product, although I don't think she was very successful. Now, our priority is getting different parts of the organisation to share the information they collect on customers, including feedback, and we're seeing positive results already. I advise everyone to do the same. My advice is that when you get comments from customers, you log them using your chosen system, and then communicate back to the customer that you appreciate their feedback. You also need to let them know what action you'll be taking, if any. Of course, the larger the company, the harder it can be to do this, so you can devise some standard answers, but encourage staff to make the message as personal as possible. Customers like it. Every business is different, so the way you approach customer service tends to be different too. I'd say don't buy software just because other companies in your industry use it. It's better to draw up a list of your requirements before you try any products. Consider who's going to use the system, what customer information they'll need, and how they'll need to access data, before you make a decision. And remember to ask staff for feedback once they start using it. I've worked in customer service and marketing departments for a while now. It's true there are lots of ways of getting data on both potential and current customers, and they can help you target your marketing more effectively. But what I'd say is, don't overlook existing data - it may still be relevant. Decreases in demand from certain customers, for example, may mean it's time you made more personal contact with them. It's amazing how much that can impact on sales.\n",
            "Today we're talking about issues relating to succession of CEOs, that is, what happens when the CEO retires and a replacement has to be found for him or her. This can be a problem in business as it can in politics. In both, it can be especially difficult when the retiring person has been a strong leader. It is not that it may be hard to find a replacement of equal ability - in most cases there will be several potential candidates. It is more a question of that person having become so identified with the role that it is hard to imagine a replacement. Let's take the example of Southern Foods. Richard Drake was CEO there for twenty years. His unexpectedly speedy retirement for health reasons threw the Board into confusion. As a result they took the easy option of replacing him with his deputy. It would have been better to wait a while before making this decision as his deputy proved quite incapable of taking over Drake's position. He had to be removed from office, but in the meantime the company suffered seriously in terms both of profits and morale. Of course some firms - typically family firms - operate according to what I call the 'royal principle'. In other words, when the CEO leaves, he's automatically followed by his son, just as a king or queen is traditionally succeeded by their eldest son. This quite often makes things easier when handover time arrives. You have a better chance of avoiding the power struggles that can sometimes make the business environment disagreeable for some members of staff. But what is most significant from the business point of view is the fact that research indicates that this kind of handover of power impacts positively on the bottom line. JK Shoes, the successful shoe company, is a family firm. When John Klindt, the founder, died after half a century in office, he was automatically replaced by his son William, who's run the firm for twenty years now. Over the same period, their main competitor, Shoe World, has gone through five different CEOs, all keen to make their own mark. All were innovative, creative people but the constant change has, on the whole, not been as successful for either customers or employees as JK Shoes' steadier approach. JK's strong customer loyalty record proves that. Yet this approach is not always possible. Most large firms these days are publicly owned and so are legally responsible to their shareholders - this is always their major consideration. In such firms, decisions about appointing a new CEO must be based on ability rather than family links. And, given that any unfairness may become public knowledge through articles in the press, appointments are handled with care. So this means that, when the time comes for a new CEO to be chosen, an open selection process has to be held with insiders and outsiders encouraged to apply. There will only be one new CEO but the selection process also offers a unique useful opportunity for an organisation to stand back and consider its way forward. However, an approach based on merit inevitably involves competition and this uses up huge amounts of energy. This is likely to result in difficulties and generate fear and anxiety among employees in even the most stable of companies - at least in the short term. But it usually gets good results, and rarely takes as long as people imagine. Any newly appointed CEO is likely to be tempted to make immediate changes. It's best to avoid that. New CEOs need above all to remember that their role is to take the long view and to discuss all issues with as many people as possible. They should then leave others to deal with the detailed planning and the introduction of any essential changes that are necessary.\n",
            "Millie here. I've received the minutes for last month's planning meeting and there are a couple of changes to be made before they can be approved. Firstly item 2, the proposal to go for a new supplier. My objection wasn't that I thought the proposed alternative supplier was inefficient but that they wouldn't be cost-effective. So I don't think we should use them. We'll have to keep looking. Then under item 4, our discussion on employment procedures, there's no record of what has been said by the most recent employees. Surely it would be useful to have that minuted? You've included the feedback we got from management. I've also got the next meeting's agenda and would like to put in another item on operating profits. I think it'd come best after the item on the budget proposal. And the last thing is an error in that agenda. It says we're going to review our pricing policy then but we decided to do that at the following meeting.

Is that near the industrial estate? It's in town, close to the commercial district. Right. And what sort of company's renting it now? It's vacant at the moment. I'm planning to open a recruitment agency - would it be suitable? Well, these premises have been used most recently as a retail unit, though most of the other businesses in the building are service companies. There's insurance, a legal office, things like that. So I think it would be very suitable. I wouldn't want to commit myself for more than a year... Actually, it shouldn't be a problem. The local council is giving a financial incentive for renting premises in that area. They pay the rent for the first three months. Oh, that's good! So do they own the premises? Um, I think most of the buildings around there are privately owned. This one was recently bought from the Business College by a company called 'Top Properties'. Fine. OK ... thanks for your help. Mm, I'll get back to you\n",
            "Mog has set his sights on the Child Genius title to make a point about parenting. I want to take part because I want to prove that you don't need to have pushy parents or be pushed to win a competition. It is important to Morgan as a person to do this, which therefore makes it important to us. I want to shuttle forward, get a hundred per cent and be able to retain my glory. Hey, Mog. Are you happy with the rules? Er... yep. OK, your time will start as soon as I start my first question. OK, are you ready to play? When I read my school report, maths was absolutely fantastic. It was above all else, so I would just say that mathematics is generally my strongest point. What comes next? One, three, five, fifteen, seventeen. Fifty-one? Yeah, apparently. Well done! Three thousand, two hundred and thirty-five minus five hundred and fifty-eight equals? Two thousand, six hundred and seventy-seven? Correct. Four thousand, eight hundred and ninety plus nine hundred and twenty-two equals? Five thousand, eight hundred and twelve. Correct. Do you ever find it hard to keep up with Mog? Yes, it's very hard to keep up with him. It's just bang, bang, bang all the time, and his skill to learn things like that is just absolutely amazing. Nineteen point three. Correct. Two hundred and ten. Correct. Two thousand, six hundred and seventy-seven? Correct. Pen down, please. After acing the written maths, Mog now faces mental arithmetic. Calculate the following: multiply eleven by four, subtract sixteen and finally multiply by three. Eighty-four. Correct. Add the following: twenty-eight plus forty-one plus ninety-seven plus twenty-four plus fifty-four plus eighteen equals? Two hundred and sixty-two. Is the right answer, Mog. Very well played. At the end of that round, you scored eleven points. Mog's impressive score has set the bar high for the rest of the competitors. Blimey!\n",
            "Hi. I'm Jack and this is the Into Film channel. Today I'm in a central London hotel to come and meet the cast of the new film Tomorrowland, and I've just come back from the press conference and I was lucky enough to give the first question to Mr George Clooney. Hi, I'm Jack and I'm 15 from Into Film. George, I wondered how important it is to make socially conscious films that appeal to my generation. Well, it's a good question, actually. That's a very good question. You guys are you a little embarrassed right now? I think it is important to do that. When I was your age, I'd grown up in a period of time where the idea was that your voice could change the world. Could. And we saw it happen. We saw things change. I think over time we've lost sight of that and I think it's really important to make a film like this that gets to say the future is not inevitable. We created it, we can change it. And it doesn't have to just be the people in the greatest amount of power. It can be, you know, a 15-year-old young reporter. So, I think it's important to make them but I'm glad that you got to ask that question. In the film, the characters are transported into Tomorrowland. During the press conference, the cast were asked where they would love to go to. Personally, I'd love to go to Greece as it's sunny and it's near the sea. Who doesn't love the sun? Anyway, let's find out what the filmmakers chose. I'd go to a forest that was filled with trees and wolves, so then I could become like a wolf-lady. Oh, with jetpacks. It had to have jetpacks in. I want to know more about, do we give the jetpacks to the wolves, or what exactly is happening here? I think that maybe we could create an animal that was mixed with the jetpack so it's like a wolf that could Wolfpack! Wolfpack! Very good, yeah! Famous for his family films, today in the press conference Brad Bird was asked, what is the secret to making films that appeal to all audiences? Do you want to know? Do you really want to know? Do you want to know? Do you really want to know? Shall I tell you? I'll tell you now. I have no idea. I'm just, like, 'That seems like a good idea'. It's not a very intellectual process. The only way that's ever made any sense to me is make a movie that I would want to see and just hope that other people would connect with that. There you go, I just can't please everyone! But I really think the audience are going to love this film as much as I did. So, with so many amazing stunts in the film, from fighting to the girls being thrown about, today we wanted to find out how they prepared for it. I trained for quite a while on martial arts. And how did George get on? I trained for minutes! With green screen, anything is possible. You can place anything in a shot and make it seem realistic. However, with some films it's good to use reality as the buildings and objects are already there. The fun part for us is that often times when you do, when you work on a film that's of a large scale, it's all just green screen and you don't really get any idea of the scope. And we were in places that either we had these giant, beautiful sets that we got to actually see, or we were in, you know, Valencia in that insane building that I've never seen anything like it. Until today I didn't know what pre-visualisation was, but it's basically storyboarding for the filmmakers so they know how every shot turns out and how it should look like in the film. Anyway, I'll let the experienced Brad Bird tell you about this now. It helps to be able to draw things to show people what you're doing, so in this film the sequence where Britt touches the pin and spends several minutes in Tomorrowland, we had to know everything that was there because the camera is constantly moving from something that's there to something that's not, and following something that's not there, and that leads you to something that is there, and animation helped with that, definitely. So, which of these transportation devices would George Clooney like the most? Teleportation Jetpack. rockets Jetpack. jetpacks. I'd do a jetpack. Got it. If you want to go and see the future, go and see Tomorrowland but we'd love to find out what you think about the technology and what you'd love to see in the future. Please comment below using your phone, computer or iPad, or typewriter. Send us a letter, or send us smoke signals. Either way, we'd love to find out what you think. Bye!\n",
            "Margot, I don't know if you were a terrible child, but do you know the story I'm talking about where, like, you do not win any awards for being a good daughter? There are many stories where I don't win awards. I was not a great daughter. I'm forever in my mum's debt because I was such a brat! I feel really bad about it. Tell us the story about when you were on your computer and she wanted your help. Oh, yes. She yes! OK, so I was on MSN - obviously the most important thing at the time! God's in the details! And we lived out, like, you know, out in the sticks. And often snakes would get into the house. And, you know, it wasn't a big deal but you just have to, like, chase them around and get it out. It was kind of time-consuming and annoying. And so, my mum yelled out and she was like, 'Can you come help me? There's this snake's really big, like, I can't get it on my own, can you come help me?' And I was like, 'I'm so busy, Mum! No! I can't!' Like, just being a brat and I was on MSN. And she was like, 'Oh, I just OK Are you? please!' And I was like, 'Be gone!' And And then, she was gone for, like, ten minutes. And I was like, 'Oh, she's been gone for ages.' And then I, like, got up from the computer. I could hear, like, this 'Mm! Mm!' And I was like, 'Oh God, what's happening?' And I see Mum. She's, like, made it halfway down the stairs. And the snake she'd tried to, like, pick this big python up with a with a broom and a stick. But it had wound its way up around her arm and was going around her neck! It was trying to choke her! I love Australia but I would never be able to live there. Well, no, I'm painting a bad picture, it's really not bad. But, um It wasn't a poisonous snake, but they do strangle you. I know, yeah! I felt so bad, and How did you get it off her? You've just got to give it something else to climb on. So you get a stick or something, it starts weaving its way around that. And then you can transfer its weight and get it off. Good to know. Yeah, that is a top tip. Or you just, you grab it behind its head. You grab it behind its jaw. Oh, they hate that. They hate it. You just don't want it to bite you. But was your mother OK? Yeah, she was fine. I felt bad and I tried not to be such a brat. When Mum asked for help in future, I kind of did it. A lesson learned. A lesson learned. Very good.\n",
            "What bird has the most elaborate, the most complex, the most beautiful song in the world? And I guess there are lots of contenders but this bird must be one of them. The superb lyre bird of Southern Australia. He clears a space in the forest to serve as his concert platform. To persuade females that come close and admire his plumes, he sings the most complex songs he can imagine, and he does that by copying the songs of all the other birds he hears around him such as the kookaburra. It's a very convincing impersonation. Even the original is fooled. He can imitate the calls of at least twenty different species. He also, in his attempt to outsing his rivals, incorporates other sounds that he hears in the forest. That was a camera shutter! and again! and now a camera with a motor drive... and that's a car alarm and now the sounds of foresters and their chainsaws working nearby.\n",
            "I decided to build Titan City because I always had an interest in architecture and the way buildings worked, and when I bought the game I just saw it as a fun way to get out any architectural ideas I had, or if I wanted to recreate a building I saw in real life. I'm also inspired by all the skyscrapers that are popping up all over the world today. I used a special program to count how many blocks were in the city, and the number it came to was roughly 4.5 million blocks used. And it wasn't that hard, laying down that many blocks. It was tedious at times but I usually multitasked while building, like I would build and watch a movie at the same time or do some light homework while building. The city was built over the span of two years. I'm not sure how much time I actually spent building the game. It's kind of broadened my horizons and introduced me to 3D effects in movies. That's what I'm trying to learn in school right now and hopefully get a job in in the future.\n",
            "I'm Lily Rice, I'm 13 years old and I ride WCMX. WCMX stands for 'wheelchair motocross' and it involves riding a wheelchair in a skatepark. You ride a wheelchair like a BMXer would ride a BMX or a skateboarder would ride a skateboard or a scooterer would ride a scooter. When did you start? I started riding in early March and we just, like, stayed on a few banks, which are basically just like small hills, going up and down. But as my confidence increased, I started to try bigger ramps and I eventually did, like, a small quarter pipe which, like, two foot. And I felt so happy when I did that. But now me looking back on that, I'm like, that's nothing compared to what I'm doing now. How did you do the backflip? The backflip wasn't really a target. We kind of just arrived in the skatepark and I was like, 'I want to try a backflip!' I practised into a foam pit first, which is like, it's just a big ramp going up into, like, a pit of foam, basically. It kind of describes itself. And we moved on to a resi ramp, which is a normal ramp made for bikes and tricks. Once I landed it, I was, like, really happy. I was ecstatic and I screamed. It's different to what other people are doing. I pull up to a skatepark, people are like, 'Why is there a wheelchair here?' And then I put my helmet on, do, like, one of the ramps and they're like, 'Oh my god!' I'd like to try a front flip, now that I can do a backflip. No woman has ever done a front flip, so I'd be the first one to do that. What is the future of WCMX? Skateboarding's going into the Olympics next year. And I really hope WCMX can go into the Paralympics as well. I want to inspire others and show people that you can do whatever you want. You just have to put your mind to it.\n",

I'm Chris. I'm from New York - America, for people who don't know where New York is! And, yeah, I'm currently living in Hanover as a language assistant. In this video I'm going to be testing Chris on his cultural knowledge of the UK, and he's going to be testing me on my knowledge of America. OK, question number one. I'm going to give you three options: A, B and C. What street, or what is the name of the street, that the British Prime Minister lives on? A: 10 Downing Street, B: 11 Chichester Road or C: 10 Dorchester Street? Do you recognise any of those names? A sounds the most familiar but I don't is that right? It's right! Oh my God! 10 Downing Street is where the Prime Minister lives. OK, so my first question is Oh, I'm scared! How many states are there in the US? 50. Ha! What is the name of William and Kate's oldest child? I wouldn't know This is Prince William, by the way. OK. No, I don't know. Not off the top of my head. If I say it begins with 'G' George? Yeah! George, Prince George. OK. I think this one's a little bit harder, but we'll see. OK. What do the stripes on the American flag represent? Oh, I don't There's 13 of them. Was it, is it something to do with the founders of the Constitution? No. It has to do with the colonies. Thirteen colonies of America? Yep, that's it. I didn't know that. Which sport is Wimbledon famous for? Oh, tennis! OK, we kind of talked about this before but this is kind of hard, so we'll see. OK. So, what do we call the four years of college in the US? What do you call the four years of college? Oh, I see - I have to name each of the separate years? Yeah. Oh, I thought OK, sorry. I thought there was, like, an overall title. OK, so there's freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. Yeah! That's it. Yeah! I'm glad I got that. OK, good. Well, I got half a point, really. That was a hard one. That was, like, four questions in one. Yeah, it was actually! OK, erm - when did London host the Olympic Games? What year? Was it in the 2000s? Yep. Relatively recently, Was it, erm, 2008? 2012? 2012, yeah! Cool. Nearly! OK. Well, this one's fun, I think. What do we call biscuits? Cookies? Yep! I knew that! I definitely eat loads Who was the first president of the United States? I knew you were going to ask me this and I was, like, 'Oh, I'll just double-check', and I haven't double-checked. I don't want to get it wrong! It's George Washington? Yep! OK, good! Because I'm always unsure whether it's George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was, like, 13th or something, I think. Yeah, yeah. OK. OK. Whew, I'm glad I got that! That could have been really embarrassing. OK, question number five: what is the nickname for an East End London accent? I have A, B or C, but if you know it, then I don't know it. OK, A: Brummie, B: Geordie or C: Cockney. It's quite a well-known accent. Is it Cockney? Yeah. What is the nickname for London's underground? So, what British people call it? Oh, the Tube? Yeah! Who created The X Factor? The name of the guy who I mean, he's one of the most He's British? Yeah. Is it Simon Cowell? Simon Cowell, yeah! You're definitely doing better than me so far, oh my gosh! I feel like my questions are harder, though. I don't know. Yours are gradually getting harder. Are they? Well, why don't we just have two more, and they're both just American words that I'm pretty sure British people don't use, so Oh, I like questions like this. OK. So, what's a doohickey? I mean, when I hear the word 'hickey' I definitely think of something It's not a hickey! OK, got it! A 'duehickey'? A doohickey. A 'do'? D-O? D-O-O. I have never heard of that, ever. There's probably loads of people watching, like, 'Oh my God, it's so obvious.' I honestly don't say it that often. I think it's a kind of older word, but Can you give me in what context would you say it? Can you say it in a sentence? Like, for example, I'd be, like, 'Oh, can you give me the doohickey?' Is it like a thingy? Yeah. Ah! So, would you say it about, like, a TV remote? Yeah, if I can't think of the word, I'll just be, like, 'Oh, give me the doohickey.' Whereas I'd just say, 'Give me the thingy.' Oh, OK. I quite like that, 'doohickey'! That's cool. Oh, it's my go. Last question. This is my last question, yeah. What is the nickname for the flag of the UK? I feel like I should know this, but I Mmm, I don't know. It's quite I don't know. Do I get a It's three words. The first one, 'the'. I feel like when you tell me, I'm going to know it, but I don't, I can't think of it right now. Are you ready to give up? Yeah. The Union Jack. Oh, yeah! I've definitely heard that! OK. OK, my last question is I really want to get this right. What's a faucet? A faucet? A faucet. Again, I think I need a sentence. I've never heard of it, so Umm How are you spelling it? F-A-U-C-E-T. Oh, OK. Does that have anything to do with So, like, turn on the faucet. Turn on? It's in the kitchen. I have never You get water from it. Tap? Yeah! You call a tap a faucet? That sounds like a different language! That doesn't sound like English. I mean, it probably came from French, I'd say. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it sounds French. Cool! So, is that it? Are we done? That's it, yeah. Well, Chris, definitely you've definitely won. Thank you ever so much for watching.

            "You might think that this orang-utan is washing socks as some kind of circus trick for which she has been specially trained, but not so. She is doing this entirely on her own initiative. She has seen others doing it and she's copying. And that ability to imitate as well as to use tools is something which started among monkeys but has been brought to a much greater level among the apes. And those two talents were ultimately to lead to the transformation of the world. Camp Leakey in Borneo is home to a special group of orangs who have been rescued from captivity and returned to the wild. Because they've lived partly in our world as well as theirs they can give us an insight into what we have in common. This old lady loves DIY. So does her son, who was born in the wild. Even her infant is interested. It's very striking when you sit as close to an orang-utan as this, to see how similar they are to human beings. We are both, of course, great apes. But look how human her hand is, the skill with which she picks things up, the way that she can grasp a tool like that. The way she uses her brain to imitate what she's seen others doing. But the most important thing we share is our big brain. It's that that has produced so many of the talents and abilities that we have in common.\n",
            "We're in the rainforest biome of the Eden Project in Cornwall, and I'm standing next to a Titan Arum in full bloom. The Titan Arum is the world's largest inflorescence. This is basically a whole bunch of flowers working as one. This one is standing at 1 metre 83 centimetres tall, but we have had them up to 2 metres 90. Scientifically known as Amorphophallus titanum and commonly known as the Corpse Flower, these huge flowering structures send their overpowering stench of decay throughout the rainforest, where they attract things like carrion beetles and sweat flies - all looking for somewhere to lay their eggs. Titan Arums are thermogenic. That means they can raise their own temperature by up to and over ten degrees centigrade. This heats up the perfume in the flower, and this structure in the middle, the spadix, convects the heat, sending the perfume throughout the forest. This flower has taken nine years to prepare for this moment. It will only be reproductive for 48 hours. On the first night the stigma and the ovaries are receptive to pollen. On the second night it will release its own pollen, but by that stage the stigma and ovaries will no longer be receptive.\n",
            "Black British history has meant lots of different things at different times. It tends to mean the story of black people in Britain, but I think it means something much bigger than that. I think it's Britain's relationship with Africa and Africans, both here in Britain, in the Caribbean and in North America, and also in Africa itself. And the reason I think it's important is because these are the stories and this is the history that explains why Britain looks the way it does today, why the faces that you see when you walk through the streets of our cities are so varied. The African story, the story of black people, is part of that complicated mix that's created the country we are today. The great Jamaican British philosopher and academic Stuart Hall once said, 'We are here, because you were there.' These are the stories that make sense of why there were people like me in Britain, black British people. But it's also a story that's been edited out, in lots of ways, of British history. For example, when we talk about the Industrial Revolution, we often talk about the way the factories and the mills worked. We learned about spinning jennies and water frames and Factories Act and child labour. We go, many of us, as children, to heritage sites where we have explained to us how those mills work. But there's one bit of the story of the Industrial Revolution that we rarely talk about, which is that the four and a half thousand mills of Lancashire and southern Scotland that are at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, producing cotton clothing, which was Britain's biggest export, employing directly or indirectly maybe one in five people in the 1850s, the cotton in those four and a half thousand mills comes from North America and it's produced by 1.8 million African Americans, who are living lives as slaves. We can't tell an honest, wholehearted, full-blooded history of the Industrial Revolution unless we tell the story of where the raw materials in the mills came from, and we've got in the habit of not doing that. We've got in the habit of telling partial histories that miss out the bits of our history that explain and show how our interaction with Africa and Africans have been repeatedly central to the British story. There's the story of the Atlantic slave trade in the 17th, 18th century. There's the story of American slavery of cotton in the 19th century. There's the story of the Scramble for Africa in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Time and again, over and over again, the story of Africa and Africans has been very central to British history. So black British history isn't a marginal subject that is only about and only of interest to black people. It is British history. It's at the centre of our story and, most importantly of all, it's a shared history. It's a story of interaction and it's a story that belongs to all of us.\n",
            "The cuttlefish has taken camouflage to the next level. They can change their colour, shape and texture to blend in with the background. It's hard to believe it, looking at these pictures, but all these cuttlefish are exactly the same species. They're simply changing their appearance, depending on what's around them. It's called 'adaptive camouflage' and it's perfect for hiding from both predators and prey. But can the cuttlefish adapt to anything? Really, you must applaud the cuttlefish for its amazing ability to blend into its surroundings. But, how clever is that, really? I mean, vanishing amongst things that are around it all the time. It's one thing for a cuttlefish to camouflage itself against seaweed, sand, pebbles and stuff like that. But how would they fare camouflaging themselves against something a bit more complicated? Something a bit like this! Yeah, I know, it's hardly Grand Designs. But I've gone for this rather lurid décor for good reason: I want to see how the cuttlefish tackle something a bit more challenging, so I've chosen stripes, chessboard and some old-style chintz. OK, time to see how they cope. Let's get our cuttlefish settled in and dim down the lights. He's having a look at it. And he's gone straight for the big one: the chequerboard flooring. And amazingly, I think he's having a crack at it. There's definitely the beginnings of a chequerboard there. He's not quite lined up right, but, you know, still impressive. Right, what next? Zebra-skin rug? Now he's improvising. Let's get him back to the task in hand. Now that's more like it! He's blending into the chaise longue a treat. But notice one thing: he's not camouflaged with what he can see in front of him, he's camouflaged with what's underneath him.\n",
            "Let's compare an apple to a can of full-sugar fizzy drink. Typically, a regular-sized soft drink contains about seven to eight teaspoons of sugar. This apple contains four teaspoons of sugar. So, have two apples and you've taken in as much sugar as you had in this can. That sugar comes mainly in two forms. One is glucose, your body's preferred source of energy, which goes straight into your bloodstream. The other is fructose, which is taken to your liver, and if not needed, is turned into fat. These are chemically identical to the sugars you get in junk food. So, if you're not careful, they can cause you the same problems. Sugar is sugar. And you're going to gain weight if you eat too much of it, wherever it comes from. So how can you get all the health benefits of fruit without overdosing on sugar? Well, the first thing is to choose your fruits carefully. Gram for gram, bananas, cherries, pomegranates, mangoes, grapes and figs all contain more than watermelon, raspberries, kiwi fruit and fresh cranberries. The riper the fruit, the more sugar it contains, so try not to leave it lying around for too long. You should eat most of your fruit whole. And no more than one glass of juice or smoothie, as digesting the fruit releases the sugar more slowly and avoids overloading your system with one big hit. Finally, don't neglect veg. There is no vitamin or mineral in fruit that you can't get from veg, in return for only a fraction of the sugar.\n",
            "I'm in London to meet Joshua Coombes. He's a hairdresser. And he believes small acts of love can make a big impact. Joshua hopes he can help the homeless, not by offering them money or food but by giving them a haircut. The reason I started cutting hair on the street, initially, was actually the magnitude of the problem, like, seeing how big this problem is in each city. It's really hard to know what to do about that. And I think it was from that feeling that I had to impact today. I had to do something positive to make someone smile. And realise that even if you can't solve a problem, actually it's OK to just do your own thing. And for me, that's hairdressing. I love what I do, so it's a great way to be able to give someone confidence. When was the last time you had a haircut? Stuart: In November last year. Morgan: So January, February. Stuart: Five months to March, April.Morgan: How do you come to be homeless, Stuart? Stuart: I broke my hip and they stopped my benefits. At the time, I was like, that's stupid. And I was getting involved with drugs and things. I didn't really care. And next thing I knew, they came round and said, 'Right, you're out.' That was 24th of January 2016 and I've been homeless since. You see lots of things with homelessness. And there's lots of stereotypes. And really, what I do is try and humanise this issue. Because, as I said, this problem's so big, I think when you bring it down to one person and tell their story, that's a great way to start and a great way for people to understand. For me, like, one of the most amazing moments is giving someone the mirror at the end of their haircut because it's great to see someone's reaction because they might recognise someone they haven't seen for a few years. Five, four, three, two, one. Ta-da.Stuart: I'm 20 years younger. Oh my God.

            "Tonight we've got rather a different programme for you. I am David Attenborough and I am 93. I've had the most extraordinary life. It's only now that I appreciate how extraordinary. The living world is a unique and spectacular marvel. Yet the way we humans live on Earth is sending it into a decline. Human beings have overrun the world. We're replacing the wild with the tame. This film is my witness statement and my vision of the future. The story of how we came to make this our greatest mistake. And how, if we act now, we can yet put it right. Our planet is headed for disaster. We need to learn how to work with nature rather than against it. And I'm going to tell you how.\n",
            "And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac. February 6th, 1952. Seventy years ago today. The day Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, became Queen Elizabeth II. Her ascent was sudden. Nairobi, Kenya's capital was in a sunny mood for the visit of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Princess was in Kenya on what was supposed to be a five-month overseas tour, when her father, King George VI, died. Word of his death first reached Elizabeth's husband, Philip, who told his wife the news that would change their lives forever. And the new queen left immediately for London, where her uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and Earl Mountbatten, uncle of the Duke of Edinburgh, were waiting to welcome the girl who left as a royal ambassador and returned as a queen. The ensuing seven decades of the Queen's reign brought periods of national prosperity and political upheaval, as well as the decline of the once vast British Empire. Prince Philip died last April, but, 70 years on, the woman who ascended to the throne at age 25 occupies it still. In June, Britain will stage a Platinum Jubilee celebration to honour a monarch who, in a world of constant change, remains a singular figure of strength and continuity.\n",
            "These dolphins have worked out that fish out of water are much easier to catch. By beating her tail down hard, this bottlenose dolphin stirs up the seabed. And by swimming in a circle, she creates a ring of mushrooming mud around a shoal of fish: a fishing net made of mud. As the net pulls tighter and tighter, the fish are trapped until there's only one way out - straight into the mouths of the waiting dolphins.\n",
            "Hi, everyone. Welcome to My Green Closet. So, today I'm going to share a few ideas for more eco-friendly ways that you can wrap gifts. So, my mother has actually been making cloth gift bags for as long as I can remember. We have a bunch of different ones in different sizes, and they've been recycled through our family throughout the years. They're really simple to make. This one is just sewn on three sides, and then has a ribbon sewn to the outside so that you can tie it up. And it's been really nice to see them get passed around. Another way you can make it is by using ribbons as a drawstring. If you'd like something a bit more practical, you can also wrap gifts in reusable tote bags or produce bags, like this one. This is a bag I made myself, just by sewing some fabric together and adding a ribbon drawstring, and I just tied on a bit of greenery to give it some decoration. I really like the look of rustic twine-wrapped presents. You can save pieces of string or twine to reuse, or I also like to use hemp twine, which is really sustainable. For wrapping paper, I'll try to use any extra paper I have, or recycled paper like craft paper or newsprint. Or newspapers can make really cool wrapping paper. And because it's a little plain, I like to tie it with twine and then add just a little piece of greenery. It's really simple but I think it looks nice. Another more personal idea is to put a photo on it. Now, I will definitely reuse paper, even if it's crumpled, and I actually kind of like the crumpled look. I think it adds an interesting texture and actually looks pretty nice. I use paper tape but there are really cool tutorials online of how you can wrap presents without any tape, and I will link one below. An easy way to decorate a present is to use any images you have, maybe from your favourite eco-magazine, and just tape that on the top. So, I decided to use this really beautiful flower illustration, and another thing that I like to do is pick up art postcards at markets from local artists, which I either send to people or I can use for decoration. And I'm just taping this on top but you could also tie it on, and again, I personally really like the rustic look of the ripped and visible tape. A really amazing way to wrap presents or all kinds of things is, I think it's pronounced furoshiki, and it's a Japanese technique to wrap things, and there are so many different tutorials of it online and really cool ways to tie fabric. So, you can use things like vintage scarves, tea towels, napkins or any kind of fabric to do this. My husband and I don't really give each other gifts. We try to do something instead, but we will give each other tiny little treats that we like, and instead of wrapping those, we just put them in a stocking. So, these are some of the ways that I like to wrap gifts for the holidays, keeping it really simple and using a lot of things that already exist and can be recycled and reused. And I would love to hear in the comments if you have any other ideas or how you wrap gifts sustainably. Thank you for watching and thank you so much to those of you supporting me on Patreon, and I'll see you in the next one.\n",
            "So here's the problem, the elephants need to be able to pull the table closer to gain access to the sunflower seeds, and they need the rope to do that. But if only one of them pulls the rope, the table doesn't move and they both go hungry. So can two elephants figure out they need to work together to solve a brand new problem? They don't get it first time out, that's for sure. But their four kilogram brains may just be at work. The first thing I think that they learn, and there has to be some learning involved in this as this is a task they've never experienced before. Erm, the first thing is that they've learned that their partner needs to be there. And I think in some ways they've learned not only does their partner need to be there but their partner needs to be doing something. After only three attempts the smartest elephants solve the puzzle. But Josh wants to know if they understand the concept behind it. So he releases one elephant before the other to see if it'll wait for its partner. After eight years of working with elephants Josh had a hunch that was going to happen and now he's got proof. What you're seeing is that the elephants are thinking about co-operation. Erm, and that actually demonstrates how smart and how well-adapted these animals are. It's incredible to prove that animals are smart enough to co-operate.\n",
            "For World Refugee Day, from my point of view, and you must say what you feel, but from my point of view it seems to me that, I mean, in many ways we're all a product of refugees. You know? We're all if you go back far enough, you'll find a refugee in your family. Oh, yeah. People have had to go because human beings commit dreadful wrongs upon one another and people have to leave their homes sometimes and they don't ever want to leave their homes. Yeah. You're talking about people who are leaving their homes! Their homes, for you know And their friends and their families and their the people that they know and the country that they know, the weather that they know, the food that they know, all the things that gives life its flavour and its Oh, then when you're leaving home: or the smells, or the excitement of friends and it just happens in a snap really, it happens involuntarily. And to me, my take on it is that it's a it's a forced situation and you have to quickly adapt to it but also accept that you have to learn new things, to incorporate your background at the same time the new environment. That's how you would survive, really. Yeah. I think you've discovered over the years that the refugees that make the best kind of fix of their lives and are happiest are those who who have tried to integrate and they've not left they've not completely left their background. No, there's no need for that. Yeah, but they've accepted that, yeah, life has to go on. And you're you know, you're speaking a new language. Your language your English is fantastic now. Yeah, it has been a long journey. Long journey. Home is always best but at the same time, you know, when things are difficult you might as well slightly move away but home is where will always be important. Yeah. Yeah, so yes. It's always a constantly learning experience. Well, as life should be! Oh! Yes! Yeah. What is life without that? It'd be an empty husk! Yeah! But it has been phenomenal, you know? An amazing journey. I think the real downside is that you've got very expensive taste in wines now. That's living with me! I was I had never tasted wine. And then I tasted it and then it became nice! There are lots of amazing moments that have happened and continue to happen and God willing, will continue. Yes. If I'm spared, because I'm a very old lady and you're still young and lovely. Oh, yes. Yeah. That's undisputed.\n",
            "It's the ultimate Christmas decoration and British people buy millions of them every year. But what impact does the Christmas tree have on the environment and should you go fake or fir? We're putting the Christmas tree to the test. First up, the natural tree. Around seven million Christmas trees are bought in the UK each year, with roughly three-quarters being grown here. It takes up to 12 years to grow a typical Christmas tree. During this time it has a positive impact on the environment because it absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and nitrogen from the soil. But once the tree is chopped down, it slowly starts releasing emissions back into the atmosphere. Transporting a tree can contribute to its overall carbon footprint, so buying a tree that's locally grown can help keep its carbon footprint down. But the biggest potential environmental impact for a natural Christmas tree comes from its disposal. If your tree ends up in landfill, its carbon footprint will be a lot higher. That's because organic matter which decomposes away from oxygen produces methane, a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. It's much better if your tree gets incinerated - burnt - or composted. That can reduce its carbon footprint by up to 80 per cent compared with landfill. You can find out from your local council what happens to your Christmas tree once you throw it out and, of course, if you have the space, you can buy a potted Christmas tree, which you can keep over the next year and use again next Christmas. So what about a plastic Christmas tree? Here, the biggest impact on the environment comes from production. Artificial trees are usually made out of a combination of metal and plastic, the production and processing of which can significantly increase the tree's carbon footprint. And most artificial trees are made in China, which means they have to be packaged and shipped to the UK. The good news is that you can reuse a plastic tree. So how many years would you have to keep it so that it has a lower environmental impact than buying a natural tree? Experts think it's about ten years, but that's a rough estimate that depends on a number of different factors such as the size of the tree. If you do decide to throw out your plastic tree, it's most likely to end up in landfill, as it's not currently recyclable. Overall, your choice of Christmas tree has a relatively small impact on your annual carbon footprint. To give you a better idea, driving 12 miles in an average-size petrol car produces as much greenhouse gas emissions as buying a natural tree. Or 54 miles if that tree ends up in landfill. If you get an artificial tree, that's roughly equivalent to driving 135 miles. Of course, there are other factors you might want to consider when you buy a Christmas tree. But in terms of environmental impact, reuse for artificial trees and disposal for natural trees are just two factors you might want to keep in mind.\n",
            "My name's Katharine Hamnett. I'm a fashion designer and I've been campaigning on sustainability for the last 30 years. In the 1980s we were on a complete roll. We did some research and I thought, 'Ah, it's gonna be fine.' Cut to the kill. Every single raw material was having a horrendous impact on the environment. People I've bought hundreds of thousands of metres of cotton from were saying, 'Why should we make it organic cotton since you're the only one asking for it?' 'Choose life' - that was our first T-shirt. 'Save the future', 'Save the bees'. Clothing purchasing is driven by desire. You know, they've got to be desirable. They can't just be sustainable. This coat is recycled polyester. Padded silk, because I was trying to find an alternative to fur, and it actually works. I think it's important, you know, as well as campaigning, to actually prove that it can be done.\n",
            "Da Vinci, Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso - they're some of the world's most famous artists, but I wonder if you noticed that all of those names belonged to men. Well, I have a question for you, Amelia. I wonder if you could name five women artists. Most people across Australia might have a bit of trouble with that. I think I would. And it really came about Annika is an artist educator here at the National Gallery of Australia, which is on a mission to teach us some new names. Some of those really famous names that you might be familiar with - you know, Picasso, Jackson Pollock - these men's names dominate the history books, but those history books were also written by men. It's not that women haven't been making great art for hundreds, even thousands and thousands, of years. They have! But for women in many societies throughout history, being recognised as an artist has been a lot trickier. In the past, women were more confined to the home, doing domestic labour, raising children. The type of art they often did create wasn't taken as seriously. And while women were the subject of many paintings, female painters often weren't welcome at the great art academies of Europe, partly because they weren't allowed to see nude male models - a common way to learn to paint people. A lot of art schools didn't welcome women in the past. When they did, they might be put into different classes or restricted in the materials and the subjects that they... that they were allowed to work with. For a long time, it wasn't socially acceptable for women to go to bars, cafés and theatres alone, which were popular scenes to paint, and their work was often overlooked or excluded from popular galleries. And does that mean that we've been potentially missing out on a female Van Gogh or, you know, these incredible artists that we might have had? Yeah, absolutely. Over the years, female artists have fought to change people's attitudes, but there's still a long way to go, as the National Gallery found out when it looked at its own collection. Of the 100,000 works of art that we care for in the Australian art collection, only 25 per cent, or one-quarter, were by women artists. That really shocked us and, I mean, I think, if you ask yourselves, 'Is that fair?' The gallery decided it wasn't and created this exhibition called 'Know My Name', featuring the work of women artists from 1900 to now, from paintings by Grace Crowley to these life-size sculptures by the Tjanpi Desert Weavers and Fiona Hall's birds' nests made from shredded US dollars. We need to change our perspective and to have a look back at all of the wonderful women artists who might have been overlooked. We need to spend time to appreciate their art and to know their names. The gallery's also working towards a more equal permanent collection, starting with its biggest female art commission yet - this big guy, Skywhalepapa by Patricia Piccinini. The Skywhales will tour around Australia and show girls that when it comes to art, the sky's the limit. This is exciting because this is something that, you know, young people can contribute to, to carve out a better future and a more inclusive future for all of us.\n",
            "The thing that will keep you going through the hard times is the fact that you really believe in what you're doing. So my first tip is find your passion. Mumsnet took a really long time to sort of take off in any business sense. In those days, it was all about young guys being invested in by young guys, and here was I turning up, a 30-year-old mum, probably with some vomit on my shoulder. And I remember one guy said, 'I will invest in your business, but only if someone else runs it.' And in fact that someone was a 24-year-old man. So I turned down his investment, but actually, you know, when you really believe in something, that's what will keep you going through the low moments. So choose something you have a real passion about, because otherwise I think it's too easy to give up. My second tip is to make mistakes. In fact, Mumsnet was born out of a mistaken holiday. It was my first holiday with kids. I knew nothing about it. And I picked the wrong destination, the wrong time zone, the wrong resort. And it was an unmitigated disaster, and that was where the light-bulb moment for Mumsnet came. Often the things that go wrong can be the prompts for what you can do right. So my next tip is to wear trainers. I think it's a brilliant way to fit in exercise without going to the gym. And it's a brilliant way to catch up if you're running late. I mean, there's also another part of this, so don't feel, as a woman in business, you have to, you know, spend hours on your appearance. Let's face it, Mark Zuckerberg wears the same T-shirt and jeans every day, and why should women have a disadvantage? And my final tip is to embrace the chaos. I think it's almost impossible to fit in everything you want to if you're trying to start your own business and you want to raise a family. You have to embrace the fact that you cannot be perfect. But more importantly, I think, it's about not feeling guilty about stuff. So my fourth child, I cycled to his nursery with him in a seat on the back, and he started singing this lovely little tune to me. He sang, 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, Mum, Mummy, Mummy, don't go to work.' And, quite frankly, if that had been my first children I would have probably been, you know, in tears on the pavement. But, you know, you do get a bit wiser, your kids will be fine, and having guilt is a wasted emotion. I think the thing that makes me get up in the morning, 18 years on, and love coming and doing what I do is I really quite like finding solutions to things. Being able to come to work and collectively, with a group of great people, grapple with stuff and try and find a solution is something I find fascinating, and it's what keeps me going really.\n",
            "This is not a drill. My name is Greta Thunberg. We are living in the beginning of a mass extinction. Our climate is breaking down. Children like me are giving up their education to protest. But we can still fix this. You can still fix this. To survive, we need to stop burning fossil fuels, but this alone will not be enough. Lots of solutions are talked about, but what about a solution that is right in front of us? I'll let my friend George explain. There is a magic machine that sucks carbon out of the air, costs very little and builds itself. It's called... a tree. A tree is an example of a natural climate solution. Mangroves, peat bogs, jungles, marshes, sea beds, kelp forests, swamps, coral reefs, they take carbon out of the air and lock it away. Nature is a tool we can use to repair our broken climate. These natural climate solutions could make a massive difference. Pretty cool, right? But only if we also leave fossil fuels in the ground. Here's the crazy part... right now we are ignoring them. We spend one thousand times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on natural-based solutions. Natural climate solutions get just two per cent of all the money used on tackling climate breakdown. This is your money, it is your taxes and your savings. Even more crazy, right now where we need nature the most, we're destroying it faster than ever. Up to 200 species are going extinct every single day. Much of the Arctic ice is gone. Most of our wild animals have gone. Much of our soil has gone. So what should we do? What should you do? It's simple... we need to protect, restore and fund. Protect. Tropical forests are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute. Where nature is doing something vital, we must protect it. Restore. Much of our planet has been damaged. But nature can regenerate and we can help ecosystems bounce back. Fund. We need to stop funding things that destroy nature and pay for things that help it. It is that simple. Protect, restore, fund. This can happen everywhere. Many people have already begun using natural climate solutions. We need to do it on a massive scale. You can be part of this. Vote for people who defend nature. Share this video. Talk about this. All around the world there are amazing movements fighting for nature. Join them! Everything counts. What you do counts.\n",

            "These Caribbean flamingos are the brightest members of the flamingo family. They are unusual in many ways. Their curved bill is a specialist bit of equipment, containing a unique structure that filters algae and small crustaceans out of the water. And this bill is the key to their parenting strategy. Their chicks are born with straight bills, that can't yet filter water to feed. So these bird parents produce milk. It's made in their throat and comes out of their mouths but has the same amount of protein and fat as milk. The hormone prolactin stimulates milk production, the same as for humans. Except, here, both parents have prolactin, so dad produces milk too. The milk is bright red, as it contains the chemicals that give the chick its pink colour until it can feed itself. The feeding drains the parents of their own colour and they start to look a bit washed out, a feeling most parents are familiar with! With both parents working together, they manage to produce enough milk to sustain their chick until its bill has developed and it's able to stand on its own two feet.\n",
            "Hi guys! I'm going to show you how to finely dice an onion. Top the onion. Then slice the onion in half. Place it down. Don't put your knife down like this, put it in at the side and using this finger as a guide to place the knife in each time. Make sure that the hand is like this. That way you won't chop off your fingers because the knife runs off the finger. The heel holds the whole onion together. You're not cutting all the whole way through, slice all the way round. Score it through. Holding the whole onion together using your finger as a guide, start slicing through. When you get to the end push the onion away, drop it down. So that you can get these last bits of onion here. And discard the stalk or use it in stocks. So that's how to finely dice an onion. If you want any more tips then click on the link.\n",

            "Hey there. Welcome to Life Noggin. When people talk about women in science, their first thought is almost always of Marie Curie - the first female scientist to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, and the first scientist to ever receive two Nobel Prizes. She won these thanks to her groundbreaking work studying radiation and discovering two new elements - polonium and radium. And while it's important to know about her contributions to science, many people's knowledge of women in STEM ends there. So today I'm going to help fix that. Let's start off with another scientist who worked with radioactive elements - Lisa Meitner. Along with physicist Otto Hahn, she discovered a new element called protactinium. But more importantly, she also noticed a strange result when uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons. See, whenever this happened, the neutron did not stick to the uranium atom. Rather, it caused the atom to split, forming lighter elements in the process and also releasing a tremendous amount of energy. Meitner called this 'nuclear fission', which led to the creation of the atomic bomb. In fact, after her discoveries were published, Albert Einstein wrote a warning letter to US President Franklin D Roosevelt, which resulted in the creation of the Manhattan Project. If you watched our video on why humans reproduce sexually, you'll know that genes have the ability to move within and between chromosomes. By studying the changes of pigmentation of corn kernels over many generations, Barbara McClintock discovered that genetic information is not stationary. However, at the time, this went against everything that was known about genetics. In fact, it took over 30 years for her work to be seriously considered - eventually resulting in her winning the Nobel Prize in Medicine. On a related subject, let's talk about DNA. You probably learned in school that its double-helix structure was discovered by scientists James Watson and Francis Crick, but this is only partially true. See, the real discovery was made by Rosalind Franklin in the 1950s. Her X-ray diffraction photographs of DNA were unknowingly shown to Watson and Crick by her colleague Maurice Wilkins. And after seeing the photo, the two scientists almost immediately published a paper in Nature, explaining their findings. Unfortunately, the Nobel Prize was awarded to Watson, Crick and Wilkins after Franklin's death, but it's unsure if she would have even been included if she had still been alive. But regardless, it's clear that we should know her name just as well as we know Watson and Crick. And lastly, let's talk about Jane Goodall. She is a primatologist and best known for her work with chimpanzees in Tanzania. During her time with them, she discovered that chimpanzees were able to make and use tools, which, at the time, only humans were thought to do. This was a huge breakthrough, and she also discovered that chimpanzees ate meat, throw stones as weapons, embrace one another for comfort and formed familial bonds. In fact, the chimps even had a war! After years of research, she speaks out for these animals that cannot speak for themselves. And on top of all of this, she is an advocate for conservation and founded the Jane Goodall Institute, a global non-profit organisation. So, clearly there are some incredible scientists that you should have learned about in school. But obviously there are tonnes more, so let me know who you want to learn about next time.\n",
            "Hello. I'm Charles from Louis Purple, and today I'm going to teach you how to tie a Windsor knot. The Windsor knot is actually a very simple knot to tie, and it's very useful because it projects confidence. So it's a wide, triangular knot that's very suitable for presentations, job interviews, or court appearances, which I hope you don't frequent too often. So this is how you start. You just find the right balance depending on the length of your tie, with the wide end on the right-hand side and the narrow end on the left. You might want to adjust exactly where the centre of the tie should be at in the middle of your neck. So this is how you start. You cross over the wide end over the narrow end. You bring the wide end through the loop between the collar and the tie. And you bring the wide end back down. Then you just pull the wide end underneath, and then bring it up through the loop again in order to have a symmetrical shape, which should look like this. And you're almost done. There's only the easy part left and the most rewarding. Pull the wide end in front. Bring the wide end underneath, and then slide it inside the loop and tie it in the knot. You draw the knot up in order to fit your collar. So it's a knot that's really suitable for widespread collars. And as I said, then you can just adjust and tighten how big of a knot you like to obtain. This is how you tie a Windsor knot.\n",
            "As you know, flu season is upon us. You're coming in contact with the flu virus and many other germs. They're on shopping carts, door handles, even around your house. You may not even realise how many times you're touching your nose, your mouth, your eyes, and you're going to get sick from it. The best way to prevent this is to wash your hands with a good old-fashioned bar of soap. The first thing you want to do - turn on the water to a warm temperature, get a good lather going in your hands. Be sure to wash the palms of your hands. Take that, wash the back sides as well. Try to focus on getting your thumbs nice and clean and soapy, and in between your fingers. And, if you can, make sure you wash the tips as well. When you're all done, rinse off your hands, take a paper towel, dry off, use the paper towel to turn off the water. The best length of time to wash your hands is 20 seconds. If you want something a little more fun, you can hum 'Happy Birthday' in your head two times, and you'll be just great. Protect yourself, protect your family this season against all the germs and viruses that are out there. Clean hands for a healthy life.\n",
            "Imagine a world without fossil fuels. None at all. Imagine a world where you never need to smell the fumes of a passing car, bus or truck and where traffic noise is massively reduced. Imagine a world powered by something you can't touch, which will be abundant for billions of years. Imagine a world where every single home has electricity, no matter how far it is from the grid. That's the future beyond fossil fuels. Imagine governments no longer needing to subsidise fossil-fuel production or spend fortunes protecting their underground fuel sources, pipes and transmission lines. Trillions of taxpayer dollars are freed up. Smog and greenhouse gases plummet. Public health improves. This healthy future is closer than you think. Our energy system is undergoing an unstoppable transformation. The coal-fired power industry that took a century to build is being rapidly replaced by sun and wind power, forces of nature which cannot be dug out of the ground or sold on commodity markets. In this totally fossil-fuel-free world, electricity belongs to everyone. It's home-grown in the true sense, bringing power to the 1.3 billion people who are currently inexcusably without it. The Paris climate agreement bound nations of the world to work peacefully for a fossil-fuel-free economy. But we need to move fast. We must harness the power of the sun and work at the speed of light. Our collective mission is to bend the curve of emissions now so that renewable energy outcompetes fossil fuels as the best new source of energy in all markets around the world by 2020. So let's thank fossil fuels for all they have done. Their contribution to humanity has been nothing short of extraordinary. However, now that we understand the dangers and the side effects and have exciting, everlasting alternatives, it is time to retire them. Pronto! The journey to our fossil-fuel-free future is the most exciting, the most innovative, the most necessary, the most inclusive and far-reaching global transformation we have ever seen. This is the answer to so many challenges in the world. The energy newtopia. The only question now is, how quickly can we get there?\n",

            "'Equal rights for women - now! Equal rights for women - now!' What defines a generation? 'Climate justice!' 'Right now!' Is it just about the year you were born? Or is there something more? We may have lived through different decades, different circumstances, different countries, but we all share in the global, everyday push for our rights, for justice, for a world that is equal. Perhaps what defines our generation isn't our age or our background but the line in the sand that we have drawn. We take to the streets to speak out against discrimination and we work tirelessly behind the scenes. We stand up for peace. 'We are fed up with the war.' And economic justice. We start with a statement and watch it become a movement. We have come a long way, but the fight isn't over, and our rights are still under assault. It is time to take action. Let us be the wake-up call the world needs. 'The eyes of all future generations are upon you.' Be the first, the youngest, the best. And then make sure no one is left behind. When someone tries to silence you, raise up your voice. 'Let us wage a global struggle!' Change everything or change just one thing - as long as you do something. Whether you're new to changing the world or have been in the fight for a long time, 'Each knows exactly why we are here.' We are all together, united for gender equality.

            "A woman who has recently inspired me is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is the youngest woman ever to be elected to Congress. She's going to become a fantastic role model for both young women and young men. A woman who really inspires me is Leslie Feinberg. She was a feminist and gender theorist. She was brave enough to live her truth in an unforgiving world, to live as a butch lesbian in '70s and '80s America despite all the discrimination and violence that she faced. My friend Kate is a real inspiration to me. When I first met her she had a stable, regular job. Then she surprised all of us by moving to Guatemala to help young women who are experiencing sexual violence find a place of safety in a refuge. A woman who inspires me is Marie Colvin. She was an American journalist and paid the ultimate price for discovering the truth. She was killed in Syria doing her job and was perhaps the bravest woman to ever be a journalist. JK Rowling. When she wrote the Harry Potter books she was in a really difficult place in her life. She managed to make this contribution, a massive contribution to children's literature. A woman that inspires me is my grandmother. She moved from London to South Africa and worked at a newspaper. She was a kind, loving, amazing human being and she set up a life for myself and my family. Phillis Wheatley. She was born in West Africa and was sold as a slave at the age of eight and she went to the US, where she learned to read and write. When she was 20 she wrote her first book of poetry - and it was the first book to be published by an African American woman ever - and lived the rest of her life as a free woman. A woman that inspires me is my aunt. She's had a couple of really rough years with my uncle having ALS and she always puts on a brave face and she always puts her family first and is just always super positive. Another woman that inspires me is Dian Fossey, just a phenomenal woman, when conservation wasn't cool it wasn't trendy and she actually got killed for something that she believed in and she just really inspires me, and I cry every time I hear the music. A woman who's really inspired me is my mum. A woman that has inspired me my whole life is my mother, Anita. A woman that inspires me is my mum. Because she has always told me to go after what I want in life and take every opportunity given to me. She always inspires me to go after what I want, no matter what roadblocks stand in my way. She's tough but caring and she's a great fashionista. She was the first person in her family to get a degree and she got that degree when she went back to school at 36 years old, and she was pregnant with me. Also she has the best chorizo pasta recipe and she's passed it down to me, so, yeah, for that I am thankful. She just inspires me with her capability basically.\n",

And they're all, like, high-fiving each other and it's all 'rad' and 'gnarly' and what have you. But it's no one's actually gone for a record, just for distance.

At that point all these rescue teams to pull the bike if it went wrong: 'We don't need them boys, I'm getting to the other side of the lake. No problem. No problem.' And I just... I got to, I think, to third or fourth gear, maybe doing sixty mile an hour. Just at that moment, when I hit the water, I just thought, 'Guy, what are you doing? Guy, what are?'. I did genuinely And I know you think this is all for TV and all that. And it's not, I genuinely Up until that point, everything was hunky-dory. And then as soon as I hit the water, 'Guy, what are you doing? Guy, what are you doing?' Over the handlebars. Bang! I was just a bit dazed. I was a bit dazed. Listen, I bet I was twenty foot away from the bike and ten foot in the air, upside down. But at that time, I couldn't hear anything. I couldn't hear anything. Just that deathly silence and I was just waiting for the impact of the water. For me, that was yeah. You'd think, 'Oh, he's only landing in water.'

            "I make the pavlova's billowy base in advance. To do this, I start by whisking egg whites. What I'm waiting for is the stage at which they form satiny peaks, then I patiently beat in my caster sugar one spoon at a time. Patience is not one of my outstanding qualities but it's necessary here. I derive great satisfaction from watching the meringue slowly become glossier. Once the mixture is stiff and shiny, I turn meringue into pavlova-base-to-be with the addition of two ingredients. First, cornflour. Usually this is combined with vinegar in a pav, but this being a lemon pavlova, I'm using lemon juice, as well as the finely grated zest, which is where all the flavour resides. Then it's a case of just folding everything gently together. Now a little culinary crafting. I dab the four corners of a sheet of greaseproof paper with the mixture I have left on the whisk, which will act as a glue to stop the sheet slipping on the baking tray. I adore how the snowy marshmallow spills onto the sheet in all its alpine glory. I'm aiming for a regular circular shape or as regular as I can get it, which means a lot of flattening and smoothing but I find this rather restful. It'll take about an hour to cook, and then it can be left to cool in the switched-off oven. I'll wait till just before my friends arrive tomorrow before piling it up into a pavlova proper. The pavlova base is cooled - well, it's been cooled for a while and resting. Cracks will appear, but don't worry! This happens and besides, as ever, I flip it over. I always do this because I love the way the tender part of the pavlova base, like a marshmallow, hits the smoothness of the cream. But actually, I am departing from tradition here because what goes on next is not cream but lemon curd. I'm happy to use lemon curd from a jar, providing it is good and zingy, and if not, you can always add some lemon zest and lemon juice. Don't be alarmed if some of it drips down the side of the meringue base. I rather love that. Push it to the sides. It will drip more as it stands. And I shall drape the curd with the cream, whipped but not too whipped! Coax it to the edges... I have got a lot of almonds I have toasted, by which I mean I've tossed them about in a dry hot frying pan until they are this colour. You need a lot. This isn't just decoration, it's so that you get a good amount of crunch. I always think of this a bit like, erm, an upside-down lemon meringue pie. And finally, some lemon zest and I just can't wait to sink into this lemony lusciousness!\n",
            "When I was a kid I always played with Lego. I built cars, planes, motorbikes. But now, I built an arm. Meet David Aguilar. My name is David Aguilar. I am from Andorra, and I'm 18 years old. When David was born, his right arm hadn't fully developed. This is the my right arm. When I was growing up, it was quite annoying because I received a lot of *commentaries like, 'Oh, you don't have a hand', or something like that. And while some would see this as a disadvantage, David is just a regular kid. He likes EDM. He goes by the name Hand Solo - get it?! He has an embarrassing dad, he goes to school This is my school. and he can open doors with his Lego arm. So cool! Growing up, he was obsessed with Lego. So much so, he wanted to make it a part of him - literally. I built my first prosthetic arm when I was nine years old, and I built it around my hand. It started being a boat. Unfortunately, the Lego bricks weren't strong enough, and it wasn't for another nine years till he would try again. This is MK1. This is Lego Technic. It's like the sophisticated part of Lego. I can do push-ups with this thing, so it's quite strong. When I first built the arm and it was fully functional, I went to the mirror and I was like, 'Uugh, er!' That model, the MK1, only took five days to build. Of course, like any good inventor, he got straight to work on an upgrade. And this is MK2. It has a battery that works like a biceps, and it has this fishing cable that ties up in here. When I fix this to my shoulder, I can do this and the arm closes. I can stop in the middle and move it by myself. When I first brought this, they were all really amazed because how can somebody create a hand out of Lego? I was a normal guy, and when I built the arm everyone was like, 'You're awesome, you're really smart.' They told me they are really proud to be my friends. It's amazing.\n",
            "The people that come here, they speak sometimes Finnish, sometimes Swedish. Sometimes we switch between sentences. Sometimes you forget. Oh, did they speak Swedish, did they speak Finnish? Just speak whatever. It's so natural for us to live in a language environment like this. Living in two languages in Finland. Well, in areas where you have both Finnish and Swedish speakers, law requires you to have signs in both languages: majority languages on top and the minority language on the bottom. With a population of almost 50 per cent Finnish and Swedish speakers, Hanko has had to swap languages regularly over the years. We don't consider it a problem, we consider it more a richness of our culture. So now the majority language Finnish. If more Swedish people move in, the majority language would change, then we would need to change all our road signs. We would do it happily. Swedish speakers are only five per cent of Finland's population. Still Swedish is an official language in Finland. Swedish is my mother tongue, then I speak almost perfect Finnish. When we speak Swedish together with friends, we always spice it with Finnish words. Finnish a very rich language and has at least 30 words describing snow, while Sweden has only a few. Most Swedish speakers live in the south and west of Finland. Ekenäs is an 85 per cent Swedish-speaking town in the south. This Finnish couple was attracted to move here by Swedish culture. Here are people who only speak Swedish and people who only speak Finnish, but, still, we are, like, managing to have conversations. They say everything in Swedish and Finnish and let you as a customer to choose which language you prefer. I grew up in central Finland and my mother tongue is Finnish. I really like this Swedish language. It's kind of round and soft. Ekenäs is a perfect match for me, because here I'm surrounded by the language. Once moving here we had this inner question that, are we allowed to be here as Finnish speakers? But we have lived here for two years now. People were super welcoming and open for us and they were eager to get to know us. When we go back to our parents' place, where you don't hear any Swedish, I kind of miss that. Everybody in the whole world should speak more languages. Without the language you cannot really get into the culture. I hope that kids learn more - maybe three, maybe five, why not six?\n",
            "Located in central London is a public park that remains hidden to even the locals. The medieval-style church of St Dunstan-in-the-East was built in around 1100, and has had a long, 900-year-old history. In 1666, it was rebuilt after being damaged in the Great Fire of London. Then, during World War Two, a direct hit during the London Blitz destroyed a majority of the structure, leaving behind only the north and south walls and steeple. Instead of rebuilding once again, the city of London decided to turn the remains of St Dunstan-in-the-East into the public garden which is accessible today - if you know where to look. Tucked away from the main road, the garden is situated between the Tower of London and London Bridge. The green, ivy-covered walls, trees and flowers offer an enchanting escape from the city and serve as a reminder of London's history.\n",

I can't think of a single ingredient that's as fast or as flexible as eggs, and I love mushrooms because I quite like that meaty texture. And these rolls with fresh mushrooms are a total godsend when I want to rustle something up in a rush. My cracking egg rolls with mushrooms are a brilliant alternative to a boring old sandwich - but still only take minutes. These rolls are like an omelette that have been wrapped in a tortilla. Beat three eggs to start the omelette centre. And then I'm going to add dried parsley. Now, I love dried herbs, so this stuff, I think it gets a bad rep. Still get that lovely flavour, so why not? And garlic granules. Sometimes I just cannot be bothered to chop garlic. You know when you just need one or maybe two. This is what you need. Banking store cupboard staples like this will give your cooking an instant flavour boost. Season with salt and pepper. That's it. That's my eggs done. Are you with me? Can you see how quick, like, this is happening? I love mushrooms. They cook so quickly. And they're packed full of deep umami flavour. You can use any type of mushroom. If I don't have any fresh mushrooms in, I'll just use the canned stuff or frozen, whatever - all of it works. And then tortilla wraps. This is the bit that kind of, like, holds your eggy, omeletty bit together. And then I've got my tomato paste. Now you could use normal tomato paste, but this is sun-dried tomato paste, so it's sweeter. That's going to pack a massive punch of flavour. Just because we're cooking fast, it doesn't mean we're compromising on flavour. Let's get some oil in there. Oil's hot. Egg in. Eggs take seconds to cook, so they're perfect when you're rushing. You can see the eggs just cooking around the edge, and then I'm going to add my mushrooms. So, just a few. And then olives. I want to cook really quickly, but I want lots of flavour, and black olives are perfect for that. You get that lovely salty kind of hit. I'm going to take my tortilla with the sun-dried tomato paste and then turn it round and stick it on top. Just kind of use your hands to just glue it together. That's it. Just don't touch it. Just leave it. Let it do its thing. After just 30 seconds, flip it over. Look at that. Can you smell that? No, you can't smell that. I can, though! Fried tortilla. That's good, right? Let's do another one. In And you'll see once you start doing this, you're going to start a production line. You'll be making more than three, you'll be doing, like, ten. You can do this with tomatoes, onions, cheese, ham - the options are endless. And here's where the roll comes in. It's not bad, is it? My crispy fried egg rolls bursting with sun-dried tomato paste, black olives and mushrooms, with a cheeky, time-saving bonus. What I love about these is that you can make a load up, stick 'em in the fridge and they're perfect for lunch the next day. And that one is going to roll straight into my mouth because somebody's got to eat it. Mmm, mmm, mmm-hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. That beats... any sandwich any day of the week.\n",

            "On the Italian island of Sardinia, there's a delicacy that's been consumed for thousands of years. It is known as the world's most dangerous cheese. Yeah, you heard right. Meet Simone Ibba, a third-generation sheep farmer. We have about 250 or 300 sheep that produce milk. We use some of this milk to make a cheese called casu marzu. Casu marzu literally means 'rotten cheese', and it's not for the faint of heart. Because this cheese is infested with thousands of live maggots. And while that might seem a bit off-putting at first, it's the maggots that give the cheese its distinctive texture and flavour. Here's how it works. First, a traditional wheel of pecorino cheese is made from sheep's milk. Then, a special fly, called the cheese fly, is allowed to lay its eggs in it. In about 40 days, the cheese wheel will be completely invaded by cheese flies and their larvae. Over the course of two to three months, the maggots eat the cheese and then excrete it out again - transforming it into the soft and creamy casu marzu. The spicy, different, tasty, doughy flavour comes from the work that the fly does. Today, it's a favourite for special occasions like weddings and birthday parties. But eating this cheese can be dangerous. Some people think that the larvae will continue to live inside you. It's not like that. Otherwise, we'd be full of maggots because we've eaten them for a lifetime. Even though cases like this are extremely rare, it's risky enough that the cheese is illegal to sell. But farmers like Simone continue to make it for themselves. Few people know how to make casu marzu cheese any more, but I've always known it; my grandmother knew it, my grandfathers, my uncles. And they just can't get enough. Casu marzu cheese with prosciutto and a slice of melon - it's to die for.\n",
            "Hi. Hi. I'm Larry. Hi. Edie. Very nice to meet you, Edie. We're going to do a little demonstration here called the rubber hand illusion. It's going to be a little scary This illusion may look like fairground fun but it reveals one of the most important new ideas in brain science. Thank you. Right there. Good. And can you put this hand down right over here? And just curl it up like the rubber hand's curled up, a little bit. All right? Now, what I'm going to do is try to position the rubber hand, so it looks like it's your own. OK. OK. Could you imagine that being your own hand, kind of? Yeah. What we're going to do is we're going to just stroke your fingers simultaneously, the rubber finger and your real finger. And hopefully this will convince you that the rubber hand is your own, that your brain will actually adopt this hand. In the illusion, simply watching the rubber hand being stroked at the same time as the real hand is enough to trick the brain into adopting it as its own. We like 'weird'. And slowly but surely, you should feel that the hand you're looking at is actually part of your body. It feels like you're touching my hand with that one. Right, so it feels like this is your hand that I'm touching, right? Yeah. Oh! Are you OK? Yeah! Yeah! Good! Try that at home with your kids. Yeah! The rubber hand illusion is a wonderful example of how multi-sensory perception can influence how we perceive our own body. I mean, that's how deep multi-sensory perception runs. When you hold your hand out, it's generally thought that you know it's there because of the information you're getting from your muscles and your tendons and that sort of thing. But what the rubber hand illusion does is show how that can be overridden by visual information. OK, here comes your fun surprise. The rubber hand illusion shows the powerful connection between what we see and what we feel. But it reveals even more than simply the way our senses are connected. It hints that a fundamental change in the brain is taking place. Oh! Isn't that strange? Yeah. That that's creepy. So what might be going on in the rubber hand illusion is that the brain is actually changing to accommodate the new rubber hand, going through some sort of, you know, structural change that we call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is an exciting new idea that suggests the brain can change in response to experience. And this is what's taking place in the rubber hand illusion. The brain may be temporarily rewiring itself to adopt the plastic hand as its own. You're really feeling like it's your hand now, huh? Yes. Is that a little weird? Yes. Yeah, we like 'weird' in perceptual psychology. Here we go. Was that scary? Yes! Good! We like that!\n",
            "Salar de Uyuni, Uyuni, Bolivia Dario Lora, manager of Luna Salada Salt Hotel: The hotel is unique. It is made of salt, it is like a museum. You can sleep in a bed made of salt bricks, you have the desk made of salt bricks, you have the floor made of salt, everything made of salt! It's the biggest salt flat in the whole world having a stretch of twelve thousand kilometres. Here's where everything begins. The people from Colchani strike the salt bricks. You can see here, lines... these small lines represent the rainy season and the sediments in the salt. We select this location in the hill so we have a really nice landscape of the salt flat. You can see all the salt flat from the Luna Salada Hotel. Here in the restaurant everything is made of salt. Here we have a table made entirely of salt. These chairs are made inside the salt flat. The local people here in Colchani they are specialists in making handicrafts, everything made of salt. Here in the hotel we are in a high altitude. We have more than three thousand metres. So one of the challenges is cooking the food at this altitude because the cooking takes more more time for the pressure than we have in the altitude. So one of the popular dishes that we have in Bolivia is quinoa. All the salt that we use in the dishes came from the salt flat. It's a better flavour to have this salt, it's stronger, the taste, and it's more pure. One of the biggest challenges we have is the rainy season is because the weather destroys all the salt bricks. That's the reason that all the time we are changing all the salt bricks around the hotel. Another problem that we have in the hotel is the corrosion in the wires. Sometimes we have to change all the wires because it is very corrosive the salt. All the wires are made of copper and we have to put a plastic tube to protect all the wires. In some cases we have to change the plugs because the salt destroys all the plugs from inside. I am excited to be part of the hotel. There is only in Bolivia this kind of hotels. It's like a piece of art.\n",

I'm probably on - and this is not an exaggeration - thousands of refrigerators. He's got the laugh... Ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. You know, that's my Santa laugh.  ... the suit... I designed my suit. But here are some other things about Santa that might surprise you. I have three tattoos on me, of me. I'm very into zombies. I love barbecuing. I have a smoker. It can fit 150 pounds of meat in it. He's got this tiki hut, an above-ground saltwater pool in his backyard. Yes, I'm that extreme when it comes to my idea of relaxation. So there's a little Frank left in there, but no question: he's fully committed to being Santa. I want to look like the poem says. 'I'm the most loved person on the planet.' We totally met Santa.\n",
            "I'm nine years old. I think it's the greatest year to be alive. So, Sierra, can you tell me what you want to be when you grow up? I want to be an author. Because it's a chance I get to use my imagination. I want to be a marine biologist when I grow up. My two favourite animals is a turtle and a jellyfish. I'd like to be a helicopter doctor because I've always wanted to be a doctor and I really love helicopters. So, can you name some authors for me? David Walliams, Roald Dahl and um... I look up to Charles Darwin and Jacques Cousteau. Do you think there's more men or women who do that job? I don't think it's a job that women would be interested in. Why? Because I think women would be more into being a nurse. There's more boys than girls that do it. Maybe girls aren't just interested in more of that stuff. Girls - they like fairies and mermaids and stuff like that, but they're not really real. We've got someone coming to meet you now. Hi, I'm Claire. Hi, Claire. I'm one of the helicopter doctors. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. How are you going? Good. I'm really excited! My name is Sam. I work here at Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and I'm a marine biologist here. My name is Jacqueline Harvey. Do you know what I do for a job? What do I do? Write. I write books. Do you like reading? Do you want to get in? Yes! Up you hop! Where you're sitting is exactly where I sit when we fly. Really? Yep! Exactly where I sit. I'm in charge of this team and I look after absolutely everything in here. So, we have two dugongs and we have a whole bunch of sharks and rays which are... I wrote a book called The Old Woman Who Lived In A Tree. Oh! So why don't you read me the first page? Once upon a time, there was an old lady who lived in a tree. One day, the old lady went for a walk. So you can be an anaesthetic doctor, or you can be an intensive care doctor or an emergency doctor. There are so many different options. Cool! Yeah. There's not really a difference about 'boy' and 'girl' writing. So they can both become an author. I was like 'Oh my gosh! I've only researched about the boy marine biologists. Now I've finally met a girl one!' Like... just a dream! Is there anything a boy can do that a girl can't do? No. If you want to do something, you do it. Good look. Suits you. Thank you. When I'm older, those little girls will have someone to look up to because that's going to be me.\n",
            "I'm greatly honoured to be given the role of People's Advocate at these coming COP26 meetings. There could not be a more important moment that we should have international agreements. The epidemic has shown us how crucial it is to find agreement among nations if we are to solve such worldwide problems. But the problems that await us within the next five to ten years are even greater. It is crucial that these meetings in Glasgow, COP26, have success and that at last the nations will come together to solve the crippling problems that the world - the globe - now faces.\n",
            "Samantha Cristoforetti, ESA Astronaut: Hello and welcome to Node 1, the place on the International Space Station where we have our meals together and it is also the place we can come mid-afternoon or mid-morning to quickly grab a snack. I'd like to show you some ideas of healthy snacks that we have here on board the International Space Station. For example we have plenty of fruit. Most of the time it's not fresh fruit unfortunately. We have fruit, for example this citrus fruit salad in strong stabilised pouches, like this one. Or sometimes we have fruit which needs to be rehydrated, like these strawberries. Or sometimes we have fruit that looks just like it would on Earth, for example this pouch of dried apple, which I like a lot! Seeds and nuts are also great ideas for a healthy snack. Here on board, for example, I have this pumpkin seeds bar and we also have plenty of nuts. How about for example some macadamia nuts? I also have this very special power bar which was made for me by chef Stefano Polato and it contains plenty of very healthy, nutritious ingredients like erm, wholegrain cereals, fruits, dried fruits, nuts, seeds and a special ingredient called spirulina and chef Stefano Polato will also show us how to make this at home! So, snack time is a great opportunity to put the right rocket fuel in your body and as always, don't panic, eating healthy is not rocket science!\n",
            "The most important items used in the coronation are the monarch's two crowns. If the Queen has only worn St Edward's gold crown once, she is much more familiar with this: the diamond-encrusted Imperial State Crown. She wore it at the end of her coronation and for most State Openings of Parliament since. You see, it's much smaller, isn't it? Significantly. I mean, it was... it was the same height. You know, it would be, it would have been up to about there when my father wore it. I mean, it was huge then. Yes, very un... unwieldy. It's difficult to always remember that diamonds are stones, so very heavy. Yes. Fortunately, my father and I have about, about the same sort of shaped head. But once you put it on, it stays. I mean it just remains, itself. You have to keep your head very still. Yes. And you can't look down to read the speech. You have to take the speech up. Because if you did, your neck would break or it would fall off! So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they're quite important things.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Maddie. Here are ten things you need to know about cats: 10. Domestic cats Have you ever noticed your cat leaves wet paw marks during summer? Unlike us humans, cats don't have sweat glands all over their bodies; instead they only sweat through their paws. For cheetahs sprinting to catch prey in hot climates, this helps to cool them down. 9. Siberian tiger The biggest cat in the world is the Siberian tiger, measuring a mighty 3.15 metres in length and weighing a hefty 265 kilograms, the same as a small motorbike. 8. Caracal The ears of a caracal are controlled by 20 muscles allowing them to pinpoint their prey. It's also speculated that their prominent tufts of fur act as antennas to further enhance their hearing ability. 7. Lion The loudest roar belongs to the lion. At 114 decibels it's as loud as a chainsaw and can be heard up to 8 kilometres away. 6. Snow leopard Snow leopards are impressive athletes, able to jump 15 metres in length and up to 9 metres high. That's six times their body length. These rare cats live at high altitudes and have extra-long tails to help them balance. 5. Keratinised papillae Cats have a hairbrush on their tongue. Comb-like structures called keratinised papillae allow them to groom and to lap up large amounts of fluid when they are drinking. Check out our slo-mo film to learn more. 4. Clouded leopard In South East Asia, the clouded leopard has the biggest teeth of any cat relative to its size. Little is known about this mysterious feline that makes noises somewhere between a purr and a roar! 3. Amur leopard The rarest cat in the world is the Amur leopard. It's thought that there are less than 35 of these creatures left in the wild owing to loss of habitat. Thankfully they are being bred successfully in captivity. 2. Margay In the Amazon rainforest, the margay is the first and only scientifically documented case of a cat using vocal mimicry to hunt. Scientists were amazed to discover it copying the sounds of a baby pied tamarin, which enticed adult monkeys to investigate and within catching distance of this clever cat. 1. Black panther The black panther is not a species of cat but in fact a jaguar, puma or leopard that is a genetic mutation. A gene called melanin causes the black pigmentation. In fact if you look closer you can still make out the intrinsic cat markings beneath the black coating. What's your favourite cat's stat?\n",
            "So, the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study. And so, this became a very famous study. And there's now many more, because after we did this about ten years ago, it became very well known. And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys. And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did. It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees. But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys. So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side by side. Again, these animals, they live in a group, they know each other. We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber. And there's a very simple task that they need to do. And if you give both of them cucumber for the task, the two monkeys side-by-side, they're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row. So cucumber, even though it's really only water in my opinion, but cucumber is perfectly fine for them. Now if you give the partner grapes - the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket - and so if you give them grapes, it's a far better food, then you create inequity between them. So that's the experiment we did. Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task, thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction, and that turned out to be right. The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber. The one on the right is the one who gets grapes. The one who gets cucumber note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine. The first piece she eats. Then she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens. So she gives a rock to us. That's the task. And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it. The other one needs to give a rock to us. And that's what she does. And she gets a grape and she eats it. The other one sees that. She gives a rock to us now, gets, again, cucumber. She tests a rock now against the wall. She needs to give it to us. And she gets cucumber again. So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.\n",
            "Today we're making red lentil fritters. And they're super simple, really nice plant protein and perfect for making, like, a big batch having on the weekend and then using for your lunch boxes and things like that. They're just really, really, really delicious, um, and so we're gonna get started. The first thing that I'm gonna do is cook the red lentils and then once they're done just drain them and place them to one side. And you start by grating my carrots. I'm gonna be a bit lazy today and skip the peeling step. Definitely peel them if you'd like to. I'm gonna chop up my red onion and my garlic. You want to chop them really nice and small though because they are gonna be mixed throughout, so you don't want massive chunks of garlic or onion or anything. Add those to the bowl as well. Then we're gonna add our gram flour, which is our chickpea flour, cayenne pepper, our paprika, a tablespoon of melted coconut oil, um, all of your red lentils and a really generous just kind of pinch or a couple of pinches of salt. And then give it a really nice stir so it creates a kind of good sticky mix and then we're just going to leave that to one side to let that set. And then once that's set, I'm gonna scoop out a large spoonful of the mixture and just use my hands to make them into patties, so we should make about 12 from this. And then heat a little bit more coconut oil in a big frying pan. Once that's hot, place a couple of fritters in the pan and cook them for like five to ten minutes or so on each side until they're golden on the outside and cooked all the way through.\n",
            "Rolling, rolling. Cue marker. The fun thing about the Arya and Brienne thing was, I don't think we had to do too much to it to make it really fun to watch, because everybody's wanted to see these two together for a long time. And if they didn't know they did, they certainly do the minute the two of them meet. Nice. It was so exciting to train for that fight. And we trusted each other. But to be fighting Gwen, who is far over a foot taller than me, and for her to be, you know, fighting someone who's far, far shorter than her, it's been a massive challenge. Generally, as you attack, you move forward, and as you defend, you move back. And they have completely different sizes of gait, of step. That was a big challenge to choreograph that and deal with those issues. We used stunt doubles for their skill sets, and also to put them in harm's way to a degree. Three, two, one, action! In a fight, it's so much more than... just choreography. Every movement says something about the character. It tells the story of these two very different warriors. Who taught you how to do that? No one.\n",
            "Water. It's life's most basic need. But there's a water crisis in our world right now. Seriously, a crisis. Nearly one billion people live without clean drinking water. It's happening all over the world, especially in developing areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and Latin America. It's a water crisis because it starts with water. But water affects everything - education, health, poverty, and especially women and children. Let's look at a family caught in the water crisis. It's likely they live on less than a dollar a day. When they're thirsty they can't just turn on the faucet for a nice, cold glass of water - they don't have a faucet. Instead, the women and children go off to collect water. Many walk up to three hours a day to the nearest swamp, pond or river to gather water that's been sitting out in the open - exposed to all kinds of germs. Time spent gathering water is time they can't spend learning to read, write, earn an income or take care of their family. Some women in Sub-Saharan Africa spend more time collecting water than any other activity they do in the day. And the walk isn't just hard, it's dangerous. The women are alone and burdened with 40 pounds of water. Many get hurt, sometimes they're even attacked. When they make it home, the little water they've collected isn't clean. Some families know their water is contaminated with germs that cause diarrhoea, dehydration, even death - but what choice do they have? Kids, especially babies, are affected most by these germs. About every 19 seconds, a mother loses one of her children to a water-related illness. And each day, almost a billion people are living this way. Until... they get a little help. The water crisis is solvable. There are solutions. Some are brand-new and innovative, like water filtration systems. Some are age-old, like drilled or hand-dug wells. These solutions bring clean water much closer to the people who need it. A safe water project near a village restores hours each day to a person's life. This time, it's opportunity. It's freedom to go to school and get an education, to work or start a business, to raise a family. Africa alone could save 40 billion hours each year - that's the entire annual workforce of France. Clean water means less disease. That's less money spent on medicine, which means more money for books and school uniforms. And if the water project is built near a school, it can increase attendance, especially among young girls. The water crisis is vast, but we can solve it. Just 20 dollars can provide one person with access to a clean water project in their village. And this will mean more than clean water... because water changes everything. Join us.\n",

            "The rainbow flag is a really important symbol for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. It has changed a lot since it was originally invented. When you see the rainbow flag, that tends to symbolise queer people, no matter who they are, how they define or who they love. This is the new lesbian flag. I think it's amazing that there are ways for us to feel that we can self-identify. I think, for lesbians, we are marginalised within the broader queer community. And I think it's great that a flag like this exists, so that we know that there are spaces that are inclusive and that we can participate in or belong to. This is the bisexual flag. It was designed by Michael Page in 1998, and the point of it was to make bisexuality more recognisable or visible within the LGBTQ+ community and society more broadly. The trans flag. It represents people who have a different gender identity to the one they were born with. Non-binary. For people who don't identify exclusively as a man or woman. The progress flag. This flag here is one of the more contemporary rainbow flags. It also includes a brown and black strip as well as part of the trans flag. This kind of does the job best for me. And I think, potentially, the flags are always going to keep evolving. So, who knows? Maybe we won't need a flag at some point. That would be my ideal.\n",
            "If I could reveal anything that is hidden from us, it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten, that we used to know as well as we knew our own names. And that is that we live in a competent universe, that we are part of a brilliant planet and that we are surrounded by genius. Imagine designing spring. Imagine the timing, the co-ordination, all without top-down laws or policies. This happens every year. There's lots of showing off. There's lots of love in the air. There's lots of grand openings. And the organisms, I promise you, have all of their priorities in order. I have this neighbour, he came up to me. And there was a wasps' nest that I had let grow in my yard, and he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps, because he had never seen one this big. And I told him, the wasps actually made that. But it occurred to me: how had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done, that we must have done it? How did he not know that we're not the first ones to build. We're not the first ones to process cellulose. We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones to try to optimise packing space, or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure. We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. People are beginning to remember that other organisms, the rest of the natural world, are doing things very similar to what we need to do, but in fact are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years.\n",
            "Normally there's this awkwardness around disability. But with that costume on there, that changed how people saw my son. They saw him first before they saw his disability. It just helps break down that barrier. 'Magic Wheelchair' is a non-profit that builds epic costumes for amazing kiddos in wheelchairs. Magic Wheelchair started when my son was three years old. Halloween rolled around and he wanted to be a pirate. We were new to the whole disabilities and wheelchair thing. We didn't know anything about spinal muscular atrophy. I saw him sitting in his wheelchair and 'Ah, we could dress him up as a pirate - be a pirate in a wheelchair. Let's Let's build a ship.' We have made probably about 40 different costumes. We have teams right now, all over the country. We have a team in France and working on a team in Australia. We're just gonna keep on boarding teams cos we wanna build year round. It's hard to build for people that are in wheelchairs. But it ultimately starts with the kid, it's whatever they want to be and then we make it a reality. Halloween was kind of our initial push, but we're seeing like Comic Con, right? I mean, what's cool about that community of CosPlay - that's a very supportive community. The cold reality of childhood diseases are some of them won't be around for next Halloween, so let's find something that we can do while they're here with us, so they have these they have these great memories and that their their families have memories when they're gone. It's almost like a cure for the day cos they don't see the wheelchair, they just see these amazing kids, and it bridges gaps and overcomes that awkwardness that we have in society. They're... star of the show. It's awesome to see.\n",
            "Who can resist an unmanned chocolate cake? Shall we lick the top? Yummy scrummy! But how best to cover your tracks? Someone mysterious sneaked in when we were Someone mysterious sneaked in? Yeah! Lying is a really important developmental skill. It tells us that the children can work out what's in someone else's mind in order to try and deceive them. A thief came in and took that. They flew down, ate it and then flew back! So, an elephant and a giant bird came and smudged the cake? Yeah! To test the children's lying skills at different ages, we left them alone with a rigged gumball machine and told them not to touch it. First, we see how the four-year-olds handle the situation. I want a sweet now. Are you going to turn it? No! Do you want to turn it? Turn it! Whoa! And it's gone! Oh no! They made Zoe turn it. Do not turn it any more! Nobody turn it any more, OK? I just keep doing it by accident! Lying is a very subtle skill. They frequently get uncovered at this age. They haven't got the ability to problem-solve their way out of it. They're not developmentally advanced enough to lie so they tell the truth. What happened?! It was Zoe! He told me to turn this thing. Elie, did you tell Zoe to turn it? Well, she didn't she yeah, but she listened. She listened! It was her fault for listening! Now it's the turn of the six-year-olds. Smarties! Sweets! They still turn the handle. They still gorge on sweets. Yeah! They still panic about getting caught. You guys, why did you touch that? But then they get rather more resourceful. I've got a really, really good plan. We've got to say one lie, we've got to say one lie. This guy's worked it out that you can lie, and as long as you've got the rest of the group complicit with you OK you get away with it. The Smarties all came out! I'm getting lots of apologies but I kind of want to know what happened. I was running like this, yeah? So then we fell and banged it. So it was my fault. How ironic for parents that at the point at which their children learn to lie, they need to celebrate that as a huge developmental stage. It shows how smart the kid is, even though it also shows that you're going to be in a lot of trouble as a parent from now on.\n",

            "For dogs too, getting out and about excites their wild senses. And for such intelligent animals, you can't beat a road trip. While we are obsessed with visual landmarks, they focus only on scents. We have a measly six million smell receptors, but a dog's nose contains 300 million. They use it to unravel stories about the world around them. Predictably, most are about food. Forty times more of their brain than ours is devoted to deciphering smells. They home in on those with special significance. A single chemical aldehyde found in blood makes this one-time hunter drool. There is a way to bring their smelly world to life. Schlieren photography visualises the air currents that carry odours and shows the remarkable workings of a dog's nose. Dogs breathe out through the side slits in their nostrils. As the expelled air rotates, it helps draw more scent into the nose. This two-way current helps a dog gather scent almost continuously. But that's not all. A male can smell a female in heat at concentrations of one part in a trillion. Licking helps capture more of her alluring scent. His tongue takes the odour to a second smell organ in the mouth, hardwired to the brain and tuned to these sexual pheromones. It's love at first sniff. For dogs, being a passenger rivals any wild experience, but it can be tinged with disappointment too. The streets of Paris may be full of romantic promise, but pet dogs are seldom in control of their destiny. Love may be in the air, but it's so rarely fulfilled.\n",
            "People were saying that I shouldn't be Irish dancing because I'm black and I don't look like most Irish dancers, but I saw it for the first time at a recital and it was just the coolest thing ever to me. When you think of Irish dancing, this probably isn't what comes to mind. This is 21-year-old Morgan Bullock, an Irish dancer from Richmond, Virginia, who recently went viral for her dancing on TikTok. Morgan was just a little girl when she saw Irish dancing for the very first time. I remember how energetic it was, and the bright dress, and it just, it just was something like I'd never seen before. It became a huge part of my life. She started going to classes a few times a week and attended dance competitions. And Morgan, when you went into those Irish dancing classes, were you the only African-American girl in the class? Yeah, I was always the only one in my class. Did that ever have any effect on you, or how did that make you feel? I mean, obviously, it's hard to miss someone who's actually their face matches their legs at the competitions, because, you know, the, there's like the tanner, you, like... There's a lot of tanner. Yeah, a lot of tanner, but it's hard to miss someone who's African American. I don't think I ever considered it an issue. It was definitely something that I took note of, but I had grown up in a predominantly white area, so it wasn't something that I was uncomfortable about. After going viral with her Irish dancing, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive, but there were a few who thought that what she was doing was inappropriate. The negative comments that people were leaving under the video, what were people saying? Just early on, like, shortly after posting it, some people were saying that what I was doing was cultural appropriation. Just because I don't look like what you would typically picture an Irish dancer to look like, but, I mean So were they saying because you weren't Irish and because you were not white that you shouldn't be performing Irish dancing? Yeah, basically that's what they were saying. You were misappropriating the Irish dancing culture. I mean, my understanding of the term is that it means when you're taking something from another culture, claiming it as your own without recognising where it comes from. And that's couldn't be further from what I'm doing, like. It's important for people to recognise that there's a difference between appropriation and appreciation. Um, I think people use the term 'appropriation' with not, without knowing what it really means. Her parents, Yolanda and Ray, have always been so supportive of her and are proud of how she's handling her online fame. It's unbelievable, it's hard to, even, you know, for family to imagine that it's happening. I'm proud how she's handling everything. She's 20, so she's a woman, so she's handling these things on her own, pretty much. After the video went viral, Morgan was invited onto a very popular Irish radio show, where she was surprised by Padraic Moyles, the lead dancer of Riverdance. If you're up for it, we'd love you to join us in Vienna, Virginia, to perform in Riverdance. Oh my God, I would love to do that. My heart just dropped. I think you're going to do an amazing job. It was unreal. Riverdance is like the end goal for me with dancing, so the opportunity to perform with Riverdance is amazing. Thank you for having the guts in many ways to put yourself out there, and you are unique in terms of what you showed on that video. It's been postponed, so I'm not sure about the dates for the US tour, but, I mean, I'll be there whenever it is.\n",

It's a device with a very special mission - to catch the ocean's rubbish, or at least some of it. It's being towed out to a part of the Pacific Ocean known as the Great Garbage Patch. The water currents here happen to make lots of plastic rubbish drift together, and I mean lots - an area almost the size of Queensland. Until now, it's been too difficult, too big, and too expensive to do much about it. That was until this guy came along, Boyan Slat. This snake thing was his idea, and it all started when he was still at school. 'I realised, back in high school, there might be an alternative.' For a school project, he designed a system of floating barriers that would be up to 100 kilometres long. They'd sit in the path of ocean currents, in a V-shape, to capture and funnel any floating plastic. Then these giant towers would suck it all up. 'Instead of going after the plastics, you could simply wait for the plastic to come to you.' We've spent a lot of time telling you about plastic pollution on BTN. 'Yup, a recent study found that Aussies discard more than 9 billion pieces of plastic every year. Unlike paper or cardboard, plastic takes a really, really long time to break down.' 'I've come to realise that our precious marine life are getting killed by the so-called innocent plastic bag.' But finding solutions hasn't been easy, and with so much plastic already in our oceans killing our marine life, Boyan and his organisation, Ocean Cleanup, are hopeful they can tackle the problem, one giant snake at a time. 'I mean, this is pretty incredible. I mean, something that we've been working towards for five years. And just having it seen from the early conceptual sketches to, you know, now the first unit actually going through the Golden Gate and heading to the Garbage Patch is pretty incredible.' It's aiming to trap some of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic that scientists estimate are swirling around here, while still letting marine life safely swim beneath it. It's fitted with solar-powered lights, cameras, sensors and satellite antennas, and the design will make it easy for boats to fish out the collected plastic every few months and transport it to dry land where it will be recycled. Boyan is now 24, and despite the years of work that have gone into this, he says the system will still get some more tweaks in the coming months. The hope is to take it even further, by letting 60 of these giant snakes loose on the Pacific Ocean by 2020. That's a lot of hungry snakes who surely won't be going hungry. But hopefully they do, at some point.\n",
            "Hi, everybody! Today, on behalf of the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel, I'm going to be showing you how to make this very easy and delicious Oreo bites recipe. My good friend Natasha actually shared this recipe with me, so, Natasha, if you're watching, thank you very much! If you do try out this recipe, please comment below, let me know how they turn out and don't forget to open up the description bar below for the precise measurements for this recipe as well as other cool links where you can see the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens latest posts and videos. I hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think of these in the comments below. Bye! For this recipe, you're going to need three ingredients: a packet of Oreos, cream cheese and chocolate of your choice to melt. I'm using dark chocolate. First, you need to crush your Oreos until they're crumbles. You can do this with a food processor, but I'm just putting my Oreos into a plastic bag and crushing them with a wooden spoon. You can also use your hands to help break up the bigger chunks into smaller pieces. Next, add in your cream cheese and mix well. It's easier to use your hands but, be warned, it's a lot more messy! Once you've combined everything well, start to roll your Oreo and cream cheese mixture into balls. They can be as big or as small as you like. Place them on a tray or a plate that will fit into your freezer. I've placed some foil on the tray, so that they won't stick to it, but you can use plastic wrap or baking paper as well. Once you've finished, put them in the freezer for a minimum of thirty minutes. You can leave them overnight to make sure they are solid before we cover them in chocolate. Now melt the chocolate of your choice in a pan. You can also put the chocolate in the microwave for thirty seconds or until melted. You don't need to add butter or anything else to the chocolate. After the chocolate has melted, let it cool down just a little bit. But don't leave it for too long, otherwise it will start to become hard again. Take your Oreo balls out of the freezer and roll them in the melted chocolate. Then place them back onto the tray and repeat! We need to pop them back into the freezer now for at least another thirty minutes so that the chocolate can solidify around the Oreo. Once they're completely hard, take them out and put them into a container. You can store these in the freezer until you want to eat them. Enjoy!\n",
            "This is a fiery snake. You see he's rearing up towards me. Ooh! And just flicked venom all down my arm. Now, look at that. Ooh! Perfect! He actually flicked venom straight at me. Actually, a little bit of it went into my mouth. You can taste it. It has a sort of rusty kind of taste to it. The venom can't do me any harm unless it gets into my bloodstream. That actually did go right into my mouth. What I'm trying to do is restrain the head so to actually give an impression of what would happen if an animal was to, was to attack it, what it would do. And he just spat straight at the camera. I think there are a few flecks of venom just on the outside of the lens, lens hood here. This gentle pressure doesn't hurt the snake but it will help me show you how cunning it can be. With the head restrained, and the snake really feeling like it has nowhere to go, the next thing that the rinkhals does is play dead. Look at that. So this is the rinkhals' last line of defence. It's been fast, it's been quick, it's been aggressive, it's spat venom at me, and now it's just playing dead. No motion whatsoever. And any animal that won't take dead prey, it's not going to be interested, it's going to leave it alone. Anything that will, and gets in too close, is going to get a nasty surprise and probably a bite. Now that's what I call a clever snake.\n",
            "That looks scary! That looks scary! Who's that?

            "I'm going to talk today about the problem of boredom. Now, it's true, we encounter boredom less and less, with all of our gadgets and with the totality of human knowledge and artistic output always available to us. When you can always hear your favourite song or watch a great film or read a great book or text a friend because you can do all of these things with the device that you have at your side 24 hours a day, you might successfully avoid boredom for the rest of your life. But you might also never discover what's on the other side of boredom. And you might not recognise the price you are paying for being compelled to distract yourself, for having lost or having simply never acquired a capacity for doing nothing. A productive capacity for doing. Once you learn to meditate, you realise that boredom is simply a failure to pay attention. If something as simple and repetitive as breathing can become a source of blissful contemplation, and it can, and if the feeling of boredom itself can become an object of intense interest, and it can, there's no way to be bored, if you're paying close attention to your experience. So training in meditation is the true cure for boredom. It's a kind of permanent inoculation. Once you learn how to meditate, you will never be truly bored again. Now, this isn't to say that you won't still make choices in life. Certain activities might still feel like a waste of time, and they might be a waste of time, given all the other things you could do. So you might still walk out of a movie or stop reading a book because it's, quote, 'boring', but when left alone with yourself, how do you feel? Are you desperate to be distracted by some stimulus? Or can you find a deep feeling of well-being as an intrinsic property of just being conscious? The gulf between these two conditions is enormous and in my experience only meditation allows us to reliably span it.\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back. This video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk about a very important topic and that is cutting down on waste. As a species, we are very wasteful of materials and resources, and it's not doing our planet any good at all. We're actually destroying it. Our decisions and consumption can affect our environment in a negative way, and no matter what scientists say about moving to Mars - this is our only planet that we get to call home, and we need to start respecting it and treating it correctly so that we don't just completely destroy it and ruin ourselves in the process. So, that said, here are some simple tips and some simple actions that you can add or incorporate into your lifestyle to help look after our planet. Before I talk a little bit about some actions that you can take into changing your lifestyle to help the environment and to help cut down on waste, I just want to jog your memory about the three Rs, which are always important to remember and that is 'Reduce', 'Reuse' and 'Recycle'. Reducing waste actually helps to prevent waste being produced in the first place, and it's probably one of the best ways to start off with because if you don't have waste in the first place, then we don't have the problem of disposing of it. An example of how you can do this is perhaps by choosing loose fruit and vegetables at the supermarket rather than fruit and veg which is packaged in plastic. Also, using a reusable plastic or metal bottle and reusable plastic containers are a great way to reduce the amount of plastic you accumulate. In my family, we use a lot of ice cream tubs, you know, the big ice cream tubs. We use them to keep our leftover food and it works perfectly fine. The second R is to reuse items. Instead of throwing things straight into the rubbish bin, why don't you see if you can reuse them again? I like to do this a lot with gift bags, which I get when I receive a present for a special occasion. I usually keep the gift bags or the boxes and reuse them when I'm giving a gift to someone else. You can also do the same thing with plastic bags. Instead of getting a new bag every time you go food shopping, just bring your old ones along, and that way you're cutting down on the amount of plastic that you accumulate. And finally, recycle. Recycling turns waste products into a new item, or, as I like to say, it gives them a second life. I've recently been clearing out my wardrobe and throwing away some clothes that I no longer like or perhaps don't fit me any more - and the money from selling them goes towards helping a charity, so it's a win-win for all. Always remember to check the back of any type of packaging for details about whether the materials can be recycled, and make a conscious effort to make sure you're both buying products that are recyclable and you're actually recycling. So, that's it for today. These are just a few starter tips on how you can make changes in your own, everyday life to help cut down on waste and to help out our planet. Of course, feel free to go online because there are loads of great, fun, exciting ways that you can also cut down on your waste and energy consumption really. Also, comment below and let me know what you're already doing to cut down on waste and if you have any great recommendations on how other people can cut down on their waste as well. I hope you have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye!\n",
            "Bumper to bumper, blood pressure rising, traffic jams are a daily headache for most drivers. So just imagine this, jumping into one of these pods, whizzing to the town centre in special lanes, without the traffic, maybe reading a newspaper as you travel. There's just one catch: there's no driver. It may sound futuristic but by 2015 this will be reality in Milton Keynes, with the government putting 1.5 million towards these driverless cars. So you just get into a driverless car, is that what you are saying? That's a bit Total Recall! If it were safe then, yeah, I'd use one. If they came to my house I'd use one. The buses are a bit naff, so Initially, twenty pods will run between the station and the centre of Milton Keynes; that'll rise to a hundred by 2017. They'll travel at speeds of around 12 miles an hour and will drive on the pavement, using sensors to avoid crashing into people. Autodriving. Google has already introduced driverless cars to California. They've driven more than 400,000 miles without a major crash - proof, it's claimed, the UK's pods can also be safe. We'll start them initially actually with driving, so people will be driving them to start with, so that people can get used to actually seeing them on the particular pathways and they can get used to interacting with them and not be frightened by them and have confidence that they are actually safe to work with. Letting go of the wheel is a huge step for many, but if they take off it is hoped these pods will cut traffic, pollution and hopefully driver stress. Siobhan Robbins, Sky News.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Ali Plum. I'm here to talk to Emma about HeForShe and the launch of the new HeForShe website. For those who don't know, what is HeForShe? HeForShe is a solidarity movement for gender equality, like, in a nutshell. Big question here what is HeForShe trying to achieve? We're trying to achieve gender equality, but I think the really cool thing about HeForShe is that we aren't just, you know, an education or an awareness campaign. It's wonderful that so many people are talking about it and it's great that so many people are talking about it but we're more than just an awareness campaign, we are mission-focused. We're really trying to erm collect, register, be aware of people that are taking action for gender equality, and, and that's really our main focus. Where are we currently in the world with the state of gender equality? Well, it's really interesting because there's this perceived notion that gender inequality was sort of a thing of the past, that we've sort of figured that one out and, you know, we're kind of where we need to be but when you start to look even just a little bit deeper beneath the surface you start to realise that actually we've got quite a long way to go. Why is it important to involve men, like myself, with this project? I think there's this perception that feminism or gender equality or women's issues are to be talked about by women, that it's for women, and you know, women are like this separate thing but of course, women are human beings and these are human rights that we're talking about so we kind of need everyone to be part of the conversation and that was really what HeForShe is about and how HeForShe was born, was that we wanted to make sure that conversation was inclusive and also we were talking to people that didn't agree with us and that was actually really important. We want to create change and so the conversation needs to be opened up to groups that perhaps traditionally hadn't been associated with engaging with feminism or gender equality. Could you give me some examples of stories from men who have become involved with HeForShe? I was on the university, er, tour for HeForShe and there was a young man who we asked, you know, like, what would gender equality mean for you and he was like, well, it would mean that I could drink my fizzy cider without my mates taking the piss out of me, and I was like, well, it doesn't sound like a very compelling reason to achieve gender equality in the world, but actually, he sort of started to elaborate more, and he was just saying that he found the pressure to fit this male mould and to conform to this kind of lad culture of like this very heavy binge drinking, actually really kind of soul-destroying and he was often ashamed of how he acted when he was on these huge, like, binge drinking, erm, things with his mates and and how he treated girls specifically when he was like that and the dude just wanted to drink fizzy cider, you know what I'm saying?! And it was just it was just really sweet, actually and I just found that, something so simple, but guys feel this incredible pressure to be... that, in order to be a man, there are all these ideas that they really have to live up to and to conform to and it's actually a bit suffocating. We're here to specifically discuss the HeForShe.org website. Why is that so important? Well, it's important because we want to be the first and largest, er, crowdsourcing tool for solutions to gender equality and the reason that is exciting is because we've had people sign up to the commitment and I've had lots of wonderful emails from men, saying all right, I'm on board, I get it, I'm into it, you know, great, but what do you want me to do? What do you actually want me to do about this now? I'm like So this has been great, and we've received hundreds of emails like this and so we've set up this website. But what's been interesting is that we haven't wanted to prescribe to anyone how best within their specific country, town, school, community whatever the best way to enact this change is and actually when people have come up with their own solutions organically, there's been some amazing things that have happened, so, erm, a man in Zimbabwe started a husband school for HeForShe, which was incredible, erm, we've had, one of our HeForShe champions, the president of Malawi, just annulled 300 child bride marriages, and sent the girls back to school, which was unbelievable, erm we've had the University of Waterloo decided that they're going to give scholarships for girls for engineering specifically, which has been amazing, so, we've kind of, we've realised that, like, you guys have the solutions and we just need to create the platform through which we can inspire you, erm, so, we've created this website and we think it's pretty awesome.\n",
            "Hey, guys! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk to you about the five things I personally think you mustn't do when you're visiting the UK. Now, I know there's a lot of information on the internet about things you must do or things you must see, but I think it's equally important to be aware of things that you shouldn't do whilst you're here, because these can help to keep you safe and help you to have a great time. My first tip is not to look left before you cross the road, and that is because in Britain we actually drive on the left-hand side of the road and not on the right-hand side, like practically everyone else in the world does. So, that means that traffic comes from your right-hand side. So, before you cross the road, remember you need to look right, left and then right again. Repeat it to me You got it, perfect! The second thing you mustn't do is believe the weather forecast in Britain because the weather is so variable and it changes all the time. Now, my advice to you would be to bring clothes that you can layer, so, you know, have a vest, have a long-sleeved top, short-sleeved tops, jumpers, a raincoat, because, honestly, you can experience all the seasons in Britain within a week of staying here. One day can be very hot and sunny and the next can be the complete opposite, especially if you're visiting London. Take my word on it - I've lived here for twenty years! So layers are definitely key. When it's hot you can take a few layers off. And also don't forget an umbrella because you really don't know when it's going to rain here. You really don't. Tip number three is don't stop in the middle of a very busy pavement to take photos. Now, I know that when you're surrounded by really cool architecture or famous monuments, you wanna be snapping, snapping, snapping and taking loads of pictures. But please don't stop in the middle of a very busy street, because people will get annoyed at you and some people are mean. It's the truth. Some people are mean - they'll push you out of the way or they'll 'tut' at you or tell you to move out of the way. So, to avoid all of that, just try and take a picture from the side of the street or from an angle or a road that looks less busy, especially if you're visiting London. In the centre of London there are a lot of people who work around there, a lot of people who walk at a very fast pace and are always off to business meetings and all that kind of stuff, so just try to avoid blocking the street. Tip number four is not to confuse England with the whole of the UK. When I was living in Italy last year, quite a lot of people referred to the UK or Britain as just 'England', and it's not the case because the UK is made up of four countries: Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland. So Edinburgh and Cardiff are not English cities. In fact, Edinburgh is in Scotland and Cardiff is in Wales. And, on top of that, just bear in mind that not everyone you're going to meet is going to be English or even Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish. Britain is a very multicultural country and there are people from all over the world who call this their home, so you need to just be aware that people are very proud of their roots and their heritage and not everyone would consider themselves English, like myself. I would consider myself to be British. So, British is a safe bet if you're not sure where someone's from. And tip number five is probably one of the most important things you need to know before you visit Britain, and that is never ignore a queue. Queuing is one of the most important social values in British culture. People really don't like it when you jump a queue or you ignore one. The only exception to this, I would say, is that if you're in London and you're queuing for a bus during rush hours then you can skip the queue, but otherwise, if you're at the airport, you're at the cinema, you're at the restaurant, you're queueing outside a museum you need to make sure that you remain in that queue because people get very touchy about it and we are very systematic in Britain. We like neat queues to be formed. So, just remember that and you will have no problem. So, these are just my five tips of things I think you should avoid when visiting Britain. Let me know in the comments below if you are visiting Britain and if these tips have been helpful. And also, comment below and let me know the five things you mustn't do when visiting your country. I hope you've enjoyed and have a lovely day. I will see you in the next video. Cheerio!\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk to you about starting to write your own blog. I started to write my own blog when I was 16 years old, and now I am 22 and I'm still writing a blog, so I think I've learned a couple of tricks and tips along the way that might be useful to any of you who are thinking about starting to write your own blog, and perhaps you just want a bit of advice and a bit of guidance. But before I share those with you, if you are undecided as to whether you should or shouldn't write a blog, here are just some reasons why I think it's a fun and helpful thing to do, and why I think you should start writing a blog too. So, I actually started with YouTube before I started blogging, and I started with YouTube as a way to document my journey from secondary school to university. I talk about the application processes in some of my videos. But after I started YouTube I then moved slowly on to blogging, and that was because I wanted a different way to document not just my university experience but also my travels, my thoughts on different topics as well. The reason why I think now blogging might be a better alternative to YouTube, for example, is because, number one, it's inexpensive. You don't have to have a camera, you don't have to have a microphone, a tripod; you don't have to have, erm, editing software on your laptop once you've, you know, filmed your video there's a lot of extra costs that go behind making YouTube videos that some people are unaware of, whereas blogging, you can sign up usually for free, and all you really need is good internet connection to upload your blog once you've written it. So, I would say blogging is a good start because it's less of a commitment. And on top of that, erm, if you are, for example, camera shy or you just want to remain anonymous, then that's absolutely possible with blogging: you don't have to show your face, you don't have to even include your name in what you write, so it's a good way to ease yourself into the world of the internet, I guess, if you are looking into going into YouTube later on, or you just want to share your opinions in a way that allows you to maintain your privacy as well. The second reason why I think blogging is a great hobby that you should take up is because it allows you to get in contact with people who are interested in the same topics as you. So, whether that's cooking, travelling, video games, shopping, home decor, whatever it is - if you start to write blogs about certain topics, and people who are interested in those topics start to follow your blogs and vice versa, then you can start up some great discussions about the things that interest you, and it just allows you to meet people who share the same interests as you, who you might not have met otherwise. As I already mentioned, blogging is a great way to mark your progress and see how far you've come on a journey or, erm, your writing style, but another great way that you could use blogging to look at your progress is perhaps by blogging in the language that you're learning. So, I did this a bit when I was learning Italian. I would write blogs that don't even have to be shared with the public. You can make your own private blog and keep that account on private, and you can just see how your writing style or your language skills develop over time. So, I think that's a great way to incorporate blogging and language learning as well. And if you are sharing your blogs written in your target language online, then that might also attract native speakers to your blogs, and they can help correct any learning mistakes that you're making on your journey. It's also really nice to look back and see how much progress you've made over, say, a year or two years, and I really enjoy that aspect of blogging - just looking back at memories or looking back and seeing how much I've progressed. And the last reason why I think blogging is a great hobby to take up is kind of linked to the last one, and that is that it gives you the opportunity to develop your writing style. When I first started writing blogs, I experimented with different tones - so some of it was comedic, some of it was more serious, some was informative, some was a bit academic - and it really allowed me to try different styles and then to develop my own writing style. So, now I would say that I have a very, erm, distinct style; I think people will know when it's me writing because of the way I write, and I think it's a useful skill that's transferable to many different areas of your life, including school and work, and it just helps you to become a more confident writer. I also think if you can express yourself in written form, it can help also with expressing yourself in person as well, and verbally expressing yourself. So, it's a great skill to develop. So that's enough anyway about why I think writing a blog is a great thing to do. If you have been convinced, then now is the time to share those tips of how to go about actually starting your blog.\n",

            "Hey, guys! This video is on behalf of the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk to you about this book which I have recently revisited called The Ancient Guide to Modern Life by Natalie Haynes. And this is a book that is very dear to my heart because as a Latin university student I often get quite a lot of people asking me, 'Why do you study Latin? It's a dead language. It's not useful. What are you going to be after you study Latin?' Hold on! So are you telling me that the foundation for Western civilisation is useless? What a lot of people take for granted is how much the Ancient Greeks and the Ancient Romans have shaped our Western culture today. Anything from our philosophy, to our literature, to our art, to our architecture, to even our governmental system. The very basis and values for the democratic governmental system which we have in the UK was actually invented back in 5th-century-BC Athens, and Natalie Haynes' book is very interesting because, as well as exploring other aspects of, erm, ancient civilisation, which has formed and shaped and continues to shape the Western civilisation today, she specifically focuses in one section about the governmental system. And whilst it has changed over time, she points out that fundamentally the values are the same; the values of equality and respect for one another, the right to exercise your voice and to be heard is still very much present in the modern day. That said, the way that democracy is carried out and the system has changed a lot since the 5th century BC. Back in those days, men would gather at the Acropolis and they would listen to the arguments put forward and they would either vote for or against with a show of hands, so they would raise their hands and each hand would be counted. Of course, nowadays that's not possible. Could you imagine 8.6 million people gathered at Parliament in London with a raise of hand? That would take a very long time to count everyone, of course. So, nowadays, we have an MP who we elect and generally the theory is that the MP will act in our best interests and represents our values. If anything, democracy has gotten better. It has become much more inclusive. Back in the 5th-century-BC Athens, women couldn't vote and neither could non-Athenians who lived in Athens. The democratic system has even leaked into other aspects of our lives. Just look at reality TV shows. As Natalie Haynes mentions in her book, stuff like Big Brother, X Factor, Britain's Got Talent - all these shows that ask you to vote for your favourite celebrity or your favourite person on the show - is a form of voting. It's a form of exercising our opinions and our voice. So, with that said, why is it that political votes aren't as popular as, perhaps, say, the Eurovisions? Perhaps an explanation for this is that in these reality TV shows, people feel that their voices are heard and that they're taken into consideration. It's hard sometimes if you're like me, just one person out of 8.6 million people in London, not to mention the other 65-odd million people in the whole of the UK. It can feel like your voice might not be heard or that you might not make a difference with your vote, but I think it's important to always remember that you do have a right to speak and you do have a voice to exercise your opinions with. I think it's important to remember that your voice is heard, that your voice does count. So, get involved with the voting, whether that's a political election or whether it's just the X Factor. You have the right to exercise your voice and you can make a difference by doing so, even though it might not seem so. Just because you're one fish in a big pond doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise your voice and be heard. So, I hope you've enjoyed this video. Please comment below if you've read Natalie Haynes book, erm The Ancient Life to The Ancient Guide to Modern Life, sorry, but if you haven't I would also recommend reading it. And if you are a Latin student or a Classicist, like I am, then definitely read it so you're armed with all the answers of why Latin and Ancient Greek should still be studied! As ever, comment below, let me know what you think about this video. Let me know what you have to say and exercise your voice and your opinion. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "Oh yeah, just one second. I'll put her on, she's just here. It's for you! Hello? Yes, I've got my lunch. Yes, I've done all my homework. Now, of course we're only joking here. You wouldn't usually put a toilet seat up against your ear, would you? Toilet seats have millions of bugs on them, but did you know that this thing could be even dirtier? And you're holding it up to your face, near your mouth, every single day. Ugh! We love our mobile phones, don't we? They hang out with us, they eat with us and even come to the toilet with us. Hello? No, I'm not busy, I'm just going to the loo, yeah. OK, gotta go. See you later. Bye. I'm here with a bunch of keen young scientists and we're about to play 'How manky is your mobile?' So, Mr O'Callahan, how are we going to find that out? Well, we can use my special gadget here. Now, all living things produce ATP. So the more ATP that we measure on this machine, the more bacteria and living things living on our phones. Sort of like a gross-ometer then, isn't it? Yeah, a bit. Anything below 100 is quite clean. But anything above 100 is a bit manky. And then anything above 200 is really gross. If it's above 200, could there be sort of harmful bugs on there that could cause diseases? Yeah, they may be harmful, but not all bugs are harmful. So just because bugs are there doesn't mean they're necessarily harmful. No. OK, that's good to know. All right, so who wants to go first? Me! All right, here we go. Oh wow! And then just put it back in like that. Pop it in there. Are you nervous? Wow! What?! Surely not! Oooh, there we go. I don't ever clean my phone! Wow! I don't really want to pick it up! I think it's going to be quite high. No way! Well, it must be broken, surely! Right, so that's everybody's phone done. This is how many of you got squeaky clean. This is how many got mildly manky. And this is how many of you got gruesomely gross. Everyone's phone is done apart from mine and Mr O'Callahan's. So, sir, I challenge you to a mobile phone gross-off. Are you up for it? Bring it on. I'm not going to look. I'm not going to look! Time for the moment of truth: who has got the grossest phone? Your ATP score was 699. Oh, that's quite gross. But mine was 2,458, so you win. Yes, I win! Although, you know what, none of us are winners here because we've all got grubby phones. I agree, yeah. I'm going to go and clean mine now. I think I might just go and give it a little wipe.\n",
            "Hi guys! Welcome to the Ministry of Food. We're gonna do omelettes. Omelettes are fantastic. They're cheap, they're flexible, you can use all sorts of different things - crispy bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheeses, you name it. I think omelettes are the kind of thing that don't really get, erm, the sort of credit they're due, actually. If they're cooked beautifully, they are incredible. They're cheap, eggs are one of the best forms of protein go free-range organic eggs - you'll be laughing. Personally, I use three eggs for a main course omelette. Just crack 'em in like this - get your egg, crack it on the side, open it up. If for any reason you got shell in there, use the half of the shell to get the shell out. And if you try with your fingers, you'll be going like this all night, and it won't work! So, pinch of salt and pepper, like that. Some people put milk and cream - I don't, at all. I've got a pan, er, the right size pan, about, sort of seven inches, I guess. That's on a medium heat. Whisk up your eggs. Just a little bit of oil, extra virgin's obviously the nicer way to go. Knob of butter in there, let that start to melt. Give it a chivvy about in the pan. You want to coat the bottom of the pan, like that. The great thing about omelettes and eggs is, if you get the first one wrong, then learn from it, try it again and just get it perfect. If it's too dark, cook it less. If it's too hard, cook it less. If it's too soft, cook it more. So, just gonna turn that down a little bit, there. You want round about a medium heat. Don't rush it, otherwise, if you cook eggs too hard and too fast, you get this kind of horrible, horrible sort of crispiness to it, which we don't like. Now, for the first twenty seconds, you can bring in the egg from the sides like this, and where there's the gap, there, don't worry - just tilt the pan. And then you can bring it in here, and then you can tilt the pan. Just like this, alright? And then after about thirty seconds, right, you want to squiggle the egg around one last time and turn the heat down a bit, and I'll put a little bit of cheddar cheese in. Now, you could use all sorts of different cheese, I think cheddar cheese is just great. You need the tiniest amount. And this is just for a basic omelette. So, just grate the cheese over the omelette like this. Erm, you can see that the egg still looks a little soft round here - that's good news, 'cause the egg, you don't want it to be overcooked and hard, erm, you want it to be silky and delicious. But, yes - you don't want it raw! So, just gonna, just let it just tick over on a low heat now, for about forty seconds, just as this sort of softness of the eggs just starts turning. You can - just look at it, you can see the egg change colour. Then, you get your slice, like this. You can just go around the edges. Don't sort of over-touch it, just go around the edges and dislodge it. Non-stick pans for this - really essential, I think, er, unless you've got a good old cast iron one. See if you can move the omelette like that - can you see how that omelette's moving, right? So, in theory, I shouldn't get any grief. So, what I do then is I tilt the omelette away, put my spatula into one side like this, get it underneath - I don't want to overcook the omelette - and just flap it, like that. That's all we want. And that is heavenly! You can see you've got a tiny bit of colour there, which is enough. Loads of colour and it's gone hard. Then, all I do is just serve it, and in the middle there you'll have a beautiful omelette. I mean, that, y'know, as a snack, with a salad, cold meats, just on its own, tiny bit of ketchup, lovely, chopped tomatoes you can start making your own omelettes up, just by frying off, say, mushrooms first, then doing your omelette like that. You could, er, fry off crispy bacon first, and then put the eggs into it. So, you can really make so many different things out of an omelette, and I want to show you inside here. What you don't want is just like a load of cooked egg, 'cause it's boring. What you want is that sort of fantastically soft, silky, sort of, inside. Can you see in there? Want it to be soft and silky, right? It's not raw egg, it's just lovely, lovely melted cheese. Nine out of ten, Oliver! See if you can get your eggs that good. Good luck, and if you're going to pass it on, at home or in the workplace, this is a great dish to do - simple but brilliant. Good luck!\n",
            "Where I come from, South Sudan, we are very strong and resilient. We've been going through war for over four decades and we are still sticking through it and still surviving, and still living and still making things. So that is in my blood. Mari Malek is a New York-based supermodel, DJ and actor. She is also a refugee. War in South Sudan forced her to flee her country as a child. After four years in a refugee camp, she was granted entry to the US. We lived in the projects. I was just an awkward child, tall, black. Where did she come from? Who is she? And I really couldn't express myself because I didn't know how to speak English. Despite many setbacks, she eventually succeeded as a model. When you do become a model, doesn't mean you get a contract and then you become rich and famous and everything is awesome. No, no, no. It's hard work, and I'm probably one of the only few black women in the industry. Mari has not forgotten her past. She advocates tirelessly for the people of her war-torn homeland. I wish I could help all of them, ... but I can't! And it hurts my heart to see children, you know, suffering like this. Her activism has taken her to the UN... and to former President Obama. She has also formed a non-profit focused on education in South Sudan. Everything that I'm doing connects because if I'm DJ-ing, modelling or acting, I always have to be doing it for a purpose and connecting it back to the story of where I come from. This is why I do this, to inspire refugee kids, to inspire anybody who's facing difficulties and think that they cannot get out of it. Yes, you can, you can do it. To be strong, resilient, never give up on myself. That's how I've made it this far.\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today I'm joined with my friend Natasha, again! You might have seen her in some of our other videos that we did. We did one when we were travelling in Berlin and we did another one which was a British vs American accent - no, was it an accent challenge? Yeah. It kind of was. Or, like, how we pronounce different words. Yeah, how we pronounce different words. So, if you haven't seen those videos, then feel free to check those out after this one, but in today's video we're going to talk about our experiences cutting our hair. And, obviously, our hair is, like, long now! It's grown back, but... I have a little Yeah, Natasha's hair has also grown back. But when we cut it, it was both very short. We'll put in some photos so you guys can have an idea of what it looked like. So, we wanted to talk a bit about our experience, just so you know, I guess, why we did it, and also if you're thinking about cutting your hair - whether for charity, like we did, or just to try something new - you have some other people's opinions, I guess, who have already done it. Why did you cut your hair? Erm, well, OK. So my mum was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she had to shave her head quite a few times. And she, she's always been someone who had a lot of meaning and emotion attached to her hair, so it was always a very sad thing for her. So, I had been thinking about it for a lot and, like, finally got up the courage to do it with her. I decided to cut my hair just because I wanted to raise some money for a British charity called Mind UK, and Mind UK basically helps people who have mental illness or are struggling with depression, and it's something that I know people who have suffered with depression and mental health illnesses, so it's a cause that I wanted to support, so I thought it'd be a good idea to raise money and try out a new hairstyle at the same time! So that's why I did it. How did you feel leading up to the day that you actually cut your hair? I was very nervous. There were a couple of times that I thought maybe I'll change my mind and do something else instead! But I'm glad I did do it. There was just a lot of apprehension, and a lot of people told me to consider it really well and make sure it was a decision I wanted to really do. So, I was a bit nervous, but how did you feel? I was also really nervous. I think for a long time I flip-flopped. And how did you feel after doing it? I think, I think immediately after, I really regretted it, 'cause I think, I think, you know, it is a big change, and it's very alarming to see yourself with no hair! So I think immediately after, I regretted it. But then, being with my mum, like, that helped me process it and, like, realise, 'Oh, it's going to be OK.' And then, as, like, as I got used to it, you know, I think it's just like anything, like getting used to a change in your life. I, actually, it was very liberating because my showers were so short! I didn't have to worry about going out in the cold with wet hair. And I actually kind of liked the way that I looked. What about you, how did you feel after? Erm there were different stages where I had, like, different emotions. I think right at the beginning I was really excited because it was, like, a new style and, like you said, it was really easy and quick to wash your hair. But I think after a couple of months it grew to, like, a weird length, and then that was kind of difficult because you had to think about how to style your hair now it's different, and, like, every week - not every week, my hair didn't grow that fast! - but every month, it was, like, almost a new not challenge, but you had to, like, think more about how I would style my hair, and there were times that I really missed my long hair. Do you have any advice for others who might be considering this big change? I would say if you are doing it, be 100 per cent sure that you're doing it for yourself or for a really good cause that you want to support. So, what I did as well is I wrote a list of pros and cons, or, like, reasons to cut my hair and reasons not to, and then that really helped me weigh up whether it was a good decision I was making. And I guess this goes for anything in life, if you're thinking about doing anything. Pros and cons are, like, really good ways to have an idea of your thoughts and see which, like, which choice you want to take. But I would say as well - of course it's good to get other people's opinions, but at the end of the day you've got to listen to your heart and what you want to do, and don't let other people make the decision for you. Before we go, another question to ask: would you do it again? I well, actually, it's interesting that you asked me that because I really miss my long hair and I think right now I'm just going to grow out my hair. I'm not going to cut it any more. But there have been times, especially, like, during the awkward stages of hair length, when I'm like, 'Oh, I just want to shave it all off again!' I think right now, I'm probably not going to do it. There may be a point in my life later on down the road when I will, but I want my long hair back. Yeah, me too, I think! It's, like, it's a nice experience, but I think I want to see the potential of how long my hair can grow. Now that I've done it once, I think if I ever was to do it again in the future, it wouldn't be so hard, or I wouldn't be as hesitant because I've already had that experience and I know what to expect. But, yeah - I guess that's it. So, thank you, guys, for watching this video. Please let us know in the comments below what you think of the topic. What do you think about cutting your hair? Have you ever done it? Would you ever do it? And we look forward to seeing what you have to say. So, have a lovely day and we'll see you in the next video, hopefully. Bye! Thank you!\n",
            "A maggot is the soft-bodied, worm-like larva of a fly that lays its eggs in living or decaying tissues, like this deceased crocodile, for instance. You may not think of maggots as being especially, well, friendly. You've probably never heard of anyone having a, a pet maggot, for instance. That's because maggots are just a transitional life stage for flies. They were eggs, now they're maggots, soon they'll be in the pupa stage and then adult flies. So why would the word 'friendly' even be used in a story about maggots? Maggot medicine! Western hospitals like this one in Wichita, Kansas, are turning back to a wound-cleaning remedy that's as old as the Civil War. If there's a wound that won't heal, sterilised, starving maggots are placed inside it to eat the infected tissue. That's the beauty of using maggots: they only eat the rotting tissue. They leave behind everything healthy that surrounds it. After two days, the maggots are removed. Their work is more clean and complete than a surgeon with a scalpel. some people see them as slimy, disgusting, repellent. And some day they just might save your life.\n",
            "So tonight we have the ultimate Sunday night supper: creamy coconut milk peanut butter miso mushroom noodles. They're unreal! You've got to make them. So, they're super, super easy. All you do is you want to slice up a pack of mushrooms and a couple of spring onions and then just boil the kettle and put your noodles on to cook. And then we're just gonna sauté the mushrooms, just a little bit of oil and salt and pepper, let them soften two minutes or so, and then we'll add a little bit of sesame oil - just adds a lovely flavour. Again, just let that cook for a minute and then we're gonna start to make it so good. So we're gonna add about half a can of coconut milk and then two really generous teaspoons of peanut butter - the more peanut butter, the better - and then that, stir that in and you'll see it getting really nice and thick and creamy. So, the mushrooms are really nice and soft now, so we're gonna add the next bits. First we're gonna add a little bit of lime juice. I think the lime juice just adds a bit of sweetness that's quite nice and makes... it's quite a kind of creamy, thick, heavy dish, perfect, sort of, Sunday night supper or comfort food, but the lime just lightens it a teeny bit. So I've just added half a lime - you can add a little bit more at the end if you like. And then we're gonna add just a tiny bit of cayenne pepper just for a little bit of heat, but if you don't like spice, don't worry and, again, you can adjust that. Just a little sprinkle, and then we're gonna add a teaspoon of miso and this just gives such a nice thick flavour. So, I'm using brown rice miso, which I prefer in something like this. I think it has a saltier flavour than the white miso, which is a little bit sweeter. So I'm just gonna stir this in. It will help it get even thicker and creamier. And you can add other veg to this as well as mushrooms - um, some spinach in here would be really yummy as well. Just before you're about to finish, just add your spring onions, just let them cook for a minute or so. And then when you're plating it up, it's just nice to add a couple more spring onions, a little bit of that fresh chilli and sesame seeds, just for a bit more colour and texture. So, here it is. So creamy, peanut butter coconut miso mushroom noodles, um, but you could swap the peanut butter for almond butter as well if you'd rather. And I just couldn't recommend it more. It will literally take you ten minutes. I'm obsessed; I've just been eating the whole thing out the pan while we perfect the final dish and... yeah, excuse me, I'm literally, I'm so excited about it. It's just the mushrooms go so soft and everything's so creamy and the noodles are so, like, ah! Just make it, tell me what you think, and make sure to come back next week, six o'clock, for bean chilli. I'm sorry - best thing in the world, right here.\n",
            "From hip hop to jazz from dance to the blues: it's music, and there's a style for everyone. Some of the greatest music in the world comes from Britain, and British music is still topping the charts today. The Premises recording studios are big players in the music industry. Everyone from Lana del Rey to the Arctic Monkeys come here. Let's find out more. If you've heard of them, they've probably played here. The Premises has been one of London's most popular studios for over 25 years. It has space for rehearsing, recording and mixing some of the best music in the world. Viv Broughton is the studio boss. Viv, tell me about The Premises.Viv: Well, The Premises is a complex of recording studios and I don't really think there's anything quite like it anywhere in the country. It's a mixture of rehearsal studios, recording studios, a lively café, storage facilities, so it's a really busy place. Hundreds of people passing through all the time.Richard: What sort of artists come here?Viv: Oh, a mixture of people. I mean, we've been going for 26 years so almost everybody you can think of has passed through the doors one way or another, so I think in the last couple of years people like Rihanna and Adele and Lana Del Rey. Last month we had Ronnie Wood in from the Rolling Stones, so it's quite a mixture of people.Richard: What is it about Britain that creates such musical talent?Viv: Ah, that's a good question. It's a bit of a mystery but there just must be something in the water or in the air. Britain produces just so many amazing bands, from The Beatles and the Rolling Stones onwards and it's a melting pot of great recording and writing talent. Britain has some of the world's greatest music festivals. This is Bestival in the Isle of Wight. For four days every year, thousands of people come to this award-winning event to listen to and watch some of the greatest music acts around. There's music here for everyone\n",
            "As-salamu alaykum! Hello, everyone! Today's video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel is going to be all about my experience of Ramadan 2017. So, I wanted to talk about some of the challenges and some of the really awesome things that I have experienced so far observing Ramadan. So, the first challenge has to be the first couple of days starting Ramadan. It was the hardest year this year because it just so happens that Ramadan has fallen on the period in which the days are getting longer in the UK because, you know, summer is starting to approach in full swing and the days are getting longer rather than shorter. The first couple of days are always the hardest for me because my stomach has to adjust to the amount of food I eat and also my eating times. If you're unfamiliar with how fasting works, Muslims cannot eat food from the time when the sun rises until after it sets, so here in the UK the sun fully sets around nine o'clock or nine fifteen in my area. Each area has it's own, er, specific time and that increases basically every day by a couple of minutes so every day the fast is getting slowly but surely slightly longer. The next challenge is waking up very early in the morning to eat, so that I can have something er substantial and nutritious to get me through the day. I wake up at about quarter to two, er, to make sure that I can eat as much as possible and drink as much as my bladder can hold, but often when I wake up I am a little bit grumpy because I've just slept for, like, three hours, erm, so, I'm sorry, Mum! Trying to go back to bed after I wake up to eat in the morning before the day begins for fasting is another personal challenge for a couple of reasons. Number one - I tend to go to bed now later because I eat at a later time, and then I stay awake for a bit just to let my food digest, and then, of course, I wake up early in the morning and I eat for about an hour, so I lose about two hours' sleep, which, you know, makes me grumpy sometimes. On top of that, erm, as I said, I try to drink as much water as I can when I wake up early in the morning before the fast begins for the day and so that often results in me having to wake up throughout the early morning to use the toilet. That said, there are a lot of awesome moments that I have experienced so far this Ramadan. One of the biggest ones for me has to be that it is a time for spiritual reflection and repenting. It's a time where I can sit down and reflect on how I want to improve myself and also reconnect with God, erm, and just focus on my spiritual journey. Another way that Ramadan has helped me to reflect is by making me realise how fortunate I am. Breaking my fast at the end of the day and experiencing that hunger throughout the day makes me realise how many people around the world are living on a daily basis hungry. And it makes me appreciate how lucky I am that at the end of the day I do have something to break my fast because that hunger for some people is an everyday occurrence. It also makes me reflect on my food consumption and I try to reduce the amount of food I waste. I try to eat portions that I know, or cook portions, that I know I will eat and definitely save leftovers. Another great thing about Ramadan is that it has made me realise the importance of perseverance and strength. I, the other day, went to a back-to-back Zumba class, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could exercise for two hours without feeling exhausted after the lesson - and it really taught me that you don't know how much inner strength and inner power you have until you push yourself to the limit, and even fasting throughout the day, you know, not drinking any water or having any food and being able to get through your day, normally, is a testimony to how much inner strength we have and sometimes we just need to tap in to that. So, I hope you've enjoyed this video. If you are fasting this Ramadan, please comment below and let me know what have been your personal challenges, as well as the rewards that you've reaped from this Ramadan so far. For all of you who are observing Ramadan this month, Ramadan Kareem and good luck with the fasting. I wish you all a beautiful and lovely day and I'll see you in my next one. Bye!!\n",
            "In Year 7 I used to, like, love filters, like, all the time but now I don't use filters at all. If you're posting a selfie of yourself and it's a nor... a normal selfie, a normal selfie, then that's fine. See, I'm not really a type of guy to use filters when it comes to my photos or... My captions are the one. I feel like, you can always think about how you present yourself online, what you post, what you're posting about. I feel like society has, like, made us, like, think that this is what we're supposed to look like in a photo, and that this is, like, the pose that we have to put. Or the filters as well... Yeah. that make people, like, want to, like, take more photos because 'Oh, I like this filter because it's so good, it makes me look covers all my spots.'

            "I remember the first time I saw a blue whale. Look, look! I'd followed them since childhood. Where do you think it's from? Is it from a ship? I could see plastic everywhere. We were in what we thought was a relatively pristine environment. I started to wonder what was happening in oceans elsewhere on the planet. Growing up, my world was the ocean. It's where I feel the most spiritual. As a free diver, it was a place where I proved myself to myself. Finally have the opportunity to pay the sea back. Only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. This is never going to degrade. It's got nowhere to go. It's something that these animals are forced to endure because it was man-made and we put it into their environment. The record is two hundred and seventy-six pieces of plastic inside one ninety-day-old chick. If the plastics are in the food chain for the dolphin then they're also in our food chain. Exactly! Communities are built on these landfill sites So sweet potatoes, corn, sugar cane, all growing on forty years of garbage. Do you have anything not wrapped in plastic? No! No! We have to make our life better for our kids' children. Change is possible! It starts with us!\n",
            "Come with me on a journey Through history and time Exploring the world's best poets And the whole thing's going to rhyme hmm, hopefully. First to ancient Greece And one guy we've got to see The famous poet Homer Who wrote The Iliad and Odyssey. Spanning nearly twenty years These two epic tales Show a king's heroic journey Through monsters, storms and gales. Now leaving Greece for China The country of this poet's birth Li Bai was thought of as a god Exiled from heaven to earth. Children still memorise his poems To this very day And it's believed nearly a thousand Were written along the way. Now you probably know this next guy For his works upon the stage But did you also know He was the poet of his age? Shakespeare's collection of sonnets Numbered over one hundred and fifty And he made up words we still use today Which I think's pretty nifty. And now to my personal favourite My fellow Scotsman, Robert Burns, Whose most famous poem, Auld Lang Syne, Each New Year's Eve returns. He even has a national day Where he is celebrated With haggis, whisky and recitals Of poems he created. Some poets are renowned in their lifetimes And are popular far and wide But others like Emily Dickinson Found more fame once they had died. Only ten of her poems were published While she was alive But now one thousand eight hundred Of her amazing poems survive. And to a poet who's a doctor Well, not a proper one that's true He brought us The Cat in the Hat and Horton Hears a Who! His colourful stories Were fun and amusing But like Green Eggs and Ham They were sometimes confusing. This poet and author Wrote of singing caged birds Spoke out on oppression And urged change with her words. 'You may write me down in history With your bitter twisted lies You may trod me in the very dirt But still like dust I'll rise.' Our final poet shows us That with passion we can succeed When he left school aged just thirteen He could neither write nor read. Birmingham's dreadlocked bard Or Benjamin Zephaniah Uses humour in his poems To educate and inspire. Poems can be beautiful or powerful And whether they rhyme or not I think they're pretty amazing And now, folks, that's your lot.\n",
            "Hello and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name is Molly and in today's video, I wanted to talk about the advantages and the disadvantages of living at home vs living independently. I thought this would be an interesting topic to talk about because a lot of people, when they're nearing the end of their teenage years or the start of their twenties, are thinking about moving out. In the UK, this happens a lot when you go to university. Obviously, moving out of your family home is a big change, and I thought it'd be interesting to talk about, from my experiences, some of the pros and cons of the different ways of living. One of the main things that's great about living at home is the familiarity. Living with your family is, oftentimes, really comfortable - you know everyone extremely well, you've lived with them your whole life, so you're in a routine, and that can be really nice. The great thing about living at home is that, most of the time, you don't have to pay rent. So, it's a lot cheaper and this is something that affects a lot of people's decisions, I think, when they're deciding when and whether they should move out: it's whether they can actually afford it. However, there are some disadvantages to living at home as well. If you move out, you have this independence; if you stay at home, there's a chance you might feel stuck in your old life. If you're at university, you might still feel like... it's like you're still at school and you don't have the freedom or the independence to go and live your own life. You might be restricted by your family's routine, which might be different to that of your friends. Particularly if you're at university, a problem, I'd say, in the UK is that if you live at home, you might miss out on the student experience. So, linked to that, if you do live on your own, there are a lot of advantages. For one thing, living alone and moving out of your parents' house is a challenge, and it's a good thing in life to try and challenge ourselves. A great thing about living alone is you can have your own space and maybe be more independent. Another great thing is that if you move out, oftentimes you'll move in with friends, and living with friends can be a lot of fun. On the other hand, just like with living at home, there are also some cons of living independently, the biggest one being cost. As I said, living at home is for the most part free, and when you move out and have to rent somewhere of your own, you realise just how expensive houses can be. Another thing that can be a disadvantage is that often you might have to live with people that you don't know, and this could be a bit scary and also may be a bit of a risk, because you don't know if you're going to get on and be friends with these people that you're having to share a house with. This is particularly the case in the UK when you go to university. We often live in halls of residence, and this is a kind of environment which is filled with loads of new people that you have to live with and you don't know any of them! So, that can be a bit daunting. And another thing, maybe if you're not living with friends or other students and you just move out on your own, there's a risk that you might be a bit lonely, especially if you're used to living in a big family with lots of things going on. It might be a bit weird at first to get used to having such a quiet individual environment. So, that's just some of my thoughts on the subject. I obviously have experience of living with my family, but also living with friends and with strangers, and I've had pretty good experiences across the board. I'd be interested to know if you guys have any opinions on this topic in the comments below. I hope you enjoyed this video, and maybe it gave you some things to think about, and I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "Hello, everyone! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Now, today I wanted us to discuss the pros and the cons of having a summer job. As it is summer, and I actually have a summer job, I wanted to talk a little bit about my experience. So, starting with the con. The first disadvantage is that, of course, you have to work. So, that means you'll have less free time to enjoy those beautiful, warm summer days. I could have gone to the park, I could have gone bike riding, I could have had a picnic, could have gone swimming, could have gone to a music festival, could have met up with my friends... the list really goes on and on and on. There's so much I think I could have done if I wasn't working, but here I am working. So, the second disadvantage follows on from the first one, and that is you could have gone travelling instead of working. Last year when I was at university I had a part-time job and that meant that I could save enough money so that I could just travel during the summer and I didn't have to work. Especially nowadays where, you know, the summer holidays are really short. I feel like they're getting shorter every year. You know, you wanna make the most of your summer holiday and I feel like you have to really choose between travelling or working, which can really suck. Working is tiring, it really is. If you think that studying is hard, or waking up for school in the morning is a chore, well, working is exactly the same - if not even worse, because at school, you know, you're usually sitting down in classes relaxing and all you really have to do is listen and just pay attention to what the teacher is saying. If you're working in a shop or a café, you'll usually be on your feet for the whole day and you don't realise how tired you are until you go home and all you want to do is have a bath and then go to bed because, honestly, during the busy summer months, especially if you live in a city like London or just a tourist area, there are a lot more tourists and that means that you will have to work a lot harder than probably during other months of the year. And my final con is that you have to wear a uniform. So, you've just finished your school, you've just finished wearing your uniform and you're thinking about all the cool summer clothes that you wanna wear. But then you realise that you're working for the whole summer, so actually you just have to wear a uniform. Sometimes uniforms aren't very comfortable and they're also not suited to the weather, so it can be a hassle... and it can be really annoying to have to put it on every morning. Now, moving on to the pros. The first pro is, of course, the biggest one and that is that you will have extra cash in your pocket to spend on things that you like or things that you want to do and no one can really tell you how to spend that money because you earned it. Now, I personally really only took this summer job because I wanted to save up my own money to go travelling just before I go back to uni. And I think it's nice to earn your own money and not always have to ask your parents for some pocket money when you go to the cinema. The second advantage is that summer jobs are great for gaining experience. Whether you're working in a shop or a café or you're interning at a bank, you will gain a lot of practical experiences, which you can use in your future career, as well as write this experience down on your CV. When you're working, you'll probably make new friends. Your colleagues are not just your colleagues but of course you're working with them every day, you're seeing them regularly, so you might actually realise you have a lot in common with someone and they might become a friend even after you've finished working there. And my final pro is that a summer job is the perfect cure for summer boredom, and I know that it may seem like the summer holidays aren't that long and they really aren't. Going to school five days a week, eight hours every day or maybe even more, when you have complete freedom, you realise that actually you can get quite bored really easily because you have to think of ways to occupy your time, and I know that when I was in school, I always thought that the summer holidays would be filled with hanging out at the park and just seeing my friends every day, but that's not always the reality because your friends have other things to do. They might be on holiday. They might have a summer job. So, really on my days off I do find myself just a little bit bored. So, this is the perfect cure if you are bored in the summer. You'll definitely have something to do and just think about the money you're earning from it. That will get you through. Now I wanna hear from you guys, so comment below. Let me know what your pros and cons of having a summer job are, and if you do have a summer job, let me know how you're finding it. I hope you're having a great day. Don't work too hard and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye!\n",
            "The rainbow flag has been used as a symbol for gay pride for many years, but where did these famous six stripes come from? Well, the flag's range of bright colours are used by some people as a symbol to celebrate people's differences and to say that everyone should feel included, no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves. It first became a symbol for the LGBT community - that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community - back in 1978, when an artist in San Francisco in America called Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on Gay Freedom Day. The flag's use spread across America from San Francisco, and by the 1990s it was known as a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for those in the LGBT community. It did originally have eight stripes, but now it has six. But what do all the colours mean? Well, the red stripe represents life; orange, healing; yellow, sunlight; green, nature; blue, art; and violet, the human spirit. Graham Bartram, an expert from the Flag Institute, says the reason the rainbow flag has caught on so well is its simplicity, which allows it to be so inclusive.\n",
            "In 1989, this guy had a vision of connecting minds. His name was Tim Berners-Lee, and he invented the web for all the world to see. It was a dream, built at CERN but the concern was great power and responsibility to learn. When you surf the internet like catching any wave, it can gather, it can travel, it can crash and it can break. Now, so much information to be found so we're swimming through this data and we're trying not to drown. 3.2 billion online. Are you aware of how to interact, who with and why? You wouldn't go surfing if you never learned to swim. Surfing on the web is a very similar thing. Be informed, think about the actions you perform. Do you give consent, where is it stored? Do you give permission if they're sharing what you sent? This is the mission and the issue is consent. Check, where is this going, why? Check, do I really want this online? You wouldn't walk down the street, with photograph ID giving your address to everybody you meet. Same applies to the internet, no matter who you are, that's why you get all them emails about GDPR. Keep your information close and personal to you. You don't have to give consent, even if they say you do. Be wise, realise real life is connected, to everything you click, hope that clicks in perspective. Consent considers consequences, consent is care, consent is asking others 'is it all right if I share?' Is it all right if I share? You wouldn't go surfing if you never learned to swim. Surfing on the web is a very similar thing. Be informed, think about the actions you perform. Do you give consent, where is it stored? But the internet was made to connect, don't be caught in a web, simply pay your respect. Sort fake from the real 'cause the real is amazing, the internet provides boundless education. 1989, that's why they made it, bringing us together 'cause together we are greater. Children are the future, compute it 'cause you will shape it. Moving to the future and we wanna make it safer.\n",
            "Hey, Amelia here, and we're bringing you a very special episode of News Break, all about the global climate strike. Millions of students all over the world have hit the streets. Marches and protests are being held in more than 3,400 towns and cities across 130 countries. We sent Matt along to check it out. Thanks, Amelia. I'm at a rally in Adelaide and lots and lots of students have come out to take part. And I'm speaking with one of them now. Why is this such a big issue for so many kids? I think this is such a big issue for so many kids because our future is being decided entirely on the decisions that are being made today. What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now! I'm here with some of the organisers of today's event. So what's it all about? Um, we have three main goals that we're putting towards the Federal Parliament in the hope that they make genuine change on them. So, we want the government committing to not allowing any new fossil fuel projects. Um, we want them to commit to 100 per cent renewable energy export and generation by 2030 and we want them to fund a just transition for fossil fuel workers and their communities so that no one is left behind. And what do you think about people being critical of kids taking the day off school, for instance, or leaving what they're doing to take part in it? I don't think they have any ground to stand on. Um, students, kids they take the day off for a bunch of less important reasons like this show or, like, the races. Um, this is an incredibly important cause and, um, this is an opportunity for them to stand up for their futures and that's definitely worth missing school for. Everybody wants us to go to school and I want to go to school because I want to get educated. But climate change is so important that through school that I've learned that we need to actually do something. And with our power we should all stand up and fight for what's right. There is so much going on right here and there are more events happening just like this around Australia and all around the world. Back to you, Amelia. Thanks, Matt. Let's check out some of those other Aussie rallies. There were massive crowds in Sydney. This is an everybody issue. People in Cairns talked about the reef. We can feel that climate change is a pressing issue, especially in Cairns, where the Great Barrier Reef is on our doorstep and dying. And there was a big turnout in Canberra. Now, with all these protests and marches happening around the world, you might be wondering how it started. Well, it was inspired by a teenager from Sweden. You probably know by now that this is Greta Thunberg, and she's the person behind this global movement. It started in August last year. She believed that her government wasn't doing enough to fight climate change. So, she decided to send a message. Every Friday, we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris Agreement. Greta's actions attracted heaps of attention. And pretty soon, millions of kids all over the world had joined in too. Greta's become an international icon. She's travelled the world, talking to world leaders, with a pretty clear message. Unite behind science. And then I want you to take real action. Of course, that's not an easy thing to achieve. Climate change is a global problem. And a lot of countries can't agree on the best way to tackle it. But the Aussie government says it does have a plan. We are committed to strong environmental protection, but in a way that is economically sensible. Greta says the best thing people can do is start small, because everyone has the power to make a difference. No one is too small to have an impact and change the world. So, just do everything you can. In keeping with all things environment, let's check out some happy stories of people doing their bit to help save our planet. These kids in Townsville are on a mission to save a tiny, endangered bird. These little cuties are black-throated finches. Experts reckon they're extinct in New South Wales and only around a thousand are left in Queensland. But the students at Belgian Gardens have managed to breed 120 over the past six years. Check this out! It's a virtual reality reef. A team of international scientists created it to provide a snapshot of what the world's coral reefs look like and how they're changing. And what better way to draw attention to the issue of climate change than to create a giant portrait of Greta Thunberg? An Italian land artist created this 27,000 square metre picture of her by ploughing through a field in Verona, Italy. Well, that's about it for today. But let us know, did you hit the streets for a climate march? Comment below. Let us know where and what you got up to. Also, hit that subscribe button so you can keep up with all the latest news.\n",
            "The question is: if you get a cloth dripping wet without gravity and you wring it out, what's going to happen? What will happen to a wrung-out cloth? So, I had to use equipment that was here on board the space station. We may have the coolest washcloths ever here on the space station. I'm going to show you. Here's one of our washcloths. And it's compacted. It's put down into this little tiny hockey puck so that, uh, it saves space. But when you open up a hockey puck and you pull out your washcloth This is the one I'm going to use for the experiment today And so when you open up your hockey puck and turn it into a washcloth. It was compressed in a great big vice somewhere. OK, so here's my washcloth. Like a magic trick. And now I'm going to get this soaking wet and then we're going to see what'll happen when we wring it out. Meredith and Kendra suggested that I dip this in a bag, but bags don't hold water in space so instead I filled a water bag - this has drinking water in it - and I'm going to, uh, squirt a bunch of water into this washcloth. OK, so here's a soaking wet washcloth. Get the microphone so you can hear me while I'm talking. And now let's, let's start wringing it out. It's really wet. It's becoming a tube of water. The water's all over my hands, in fact. It wrings out of the cloth into my hands. And if I let go of the cloth carefully, the water sort of has it stick to my hand. OK, so the, uh, experiment worked beautifully. And the answer to the question is, the water squeezes out of the cloth and then because of the surface tension of the water, it, um, it actually runs along the surface of the cloth and then up into my hand, almost like you had Jell-O on your hands or gel on your hand. And it'll just stay there. Wonderful moisturiser on my hands. And the cloth doesn't really unravel itself. It just stays there, floating, like a, uh, like a dog's chew toy, soaking wet. Great experiment. Worked perfectly. Meredith and Kendra, congratulations! Great idea.\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video, I wanted to share this very simple and yummy vegan banana recipe - wait, vegan banana pancakes recipe. That's what I meant to say! A quick disclaimer - I myself am not vegan, but I love to make this recipe because it is so easy and simple. You literally only need three ingredients, which you probably have already in your house, and on top of that I like to call this the 'healthy' version because it doesn't use a lot of oil, it's not heavy, it's not thick like traditional pancakes, so I can get away with eating this a lot more. It also has banana in it, so that can be counted as one of your five a day. Let me know at the end of the video in the comments below what you think of this recipe. If you do try it out, let me know how you find it - if you think it's tasty or you prefer traditional pancakes, and let's get on with the making! The three main ingredients we need for this recipe are bananas, flour and some kind of milk. If you're not vegan, you can use just normal milk. I'm using a soya milk, which is a plant-based alternative milk. You can use almond milk, oats milk, coconut milk, whatever milk you usually use. The little pink sachet is actually bicarbonate of soda, and this is optional. You can add this just to make the pancakes fluffy, but it's not essential by any means. So, the first thing we're going to do is to peel our bananas and then to dice them up. We are then going to transfer it into a bowl, or I'm using this kind of measuring jug. That way I can just pour the mixture afterwards. And, as you can see, I'm very messy because I was trying to balance my camera! I don't have a tripod and I was also trying to mush at the same time. So, sorry if you get a couple of close-up angles. OK, so we're going to mush the banana until it's basically a very nice paste. It doesn't have to be lump-free. You can do this with a blender or a food processor, but mashing it with a fork works just as well. Next, we're going to pour in our flour, and I would use 500 grams of plain flour for the two bananas. And now we're going to combine the flour and the banana well. At this point, the banana and flour mixture should kind of make a doughy consistency, and that's when you want to add in your cup of milk and mix it up to thin out the batter. Once you have a thin enough batter, just like normal pancake batter, it's not too runny, kind of yogurt consistency, but it drops off the spoon - that's the best way I can describe it. You'll know when it's there. And once we're there we're going to get out a pan, and you're going to need to use either butter, a fat or some type of oil to stop the pancake from sticking to the pan. I'm using an olive oil spread. Now, the next part is really up to you how thin or thick you want your pancake to be. The only thing I would say is just to make sure it's not too thick - otherwise, it won't cook in the middle because these banana pancakes are quite dense. So, once it's cooked on one side, I'm just going to flip it over and cook it on the other side. That's the first one done, and a couple more to go. And this is what it looks like when it's ready. I've just chopped up some strawberries and put on a bit of sugar to serve it. You can put whatever toppings you want - blueberries, any fresh fruits, more bananas if you like, yogurt, honey it really is up to you. I hope you guys have enjoyed this video, and let me know what you think, as I said, in the comments below, and happy pancake-making! See you guys in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "It allows me to keep in contact with my friends. It's interesting to see what other people are doing without being nosy about it. You can find the best memes on the internet. I just like posting pictures of myself. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, 100%. Oh, definitely, yeah! Definitely. Woman: Yeah. Woman: Definitely! Woman: Yeah, it can. Everything on social media I find very curated. You can create your own, kind of like, lifestyle online so you can have a fake lifestyle. I know that I've spent maybe, like, half an hour taking, like, the perfect, like, studying picture. You do feel a bit intimidated. You go on your explore page and then you see somebody with, I dunno, a better car than you, better grades than you, like, a fitter girlfriend than you... Like, it could, it could be anything and you'll always want more. I think it's just made things really superficial. They try and compare themselves to people on Insta and they don't know that these people are, like, photoshopping in the background and doing all this extra stuff. It's quite a depressing thing if you're climbing up to get somewhere but you're never going to reach. Uff. Hmm. Instagram, I think? Instagram, by far. Was that right? Between Instagram and Twitter. Probably Facebook. Facebook. Snapchat actually. Honestly, I think Tinder. Real talk, real talk! Was I wrong?\n",
            "Right let's go, we've got Jamie McDonald there and he is the man who is in... where are you, Jamie? Vancouver, excellent, so have you done it? Is it all over? It's over, Eamonn, it's all over! Brilliant and how are you? How are you feeling and how are your feet? Feet are kinda a little bit off, off-key but I've done it and that's all that matters. I cried like a little baby... Brilliant, brilliant, Jamie, for anybody that hasn't followed your journey or don't know what we are both talking about here, tell them what the 'feat' was. So I ran over 200 marathons across Canada in less than three hundred days, without a support crew, erm, it was absolute hell! I was fundraising for the children's hospitals. And your hair's grown, we see, in that time. You obviously haven't had time to stop off at the barber's. I had a shave, just for you though, Eamonn. Absolutely brilliant. Now you had a few wee hiccups on the way, you know, you had that wee business where you were, you were robbed and er... whatever, but everything turned out OK. Yeah, you know like it was a battle and I ended up running in kind of minus 40 temperatures, where I got frostbite, and then on New Year's Eve I got beat up and mugged but luckily I got everything back. I... just not my money but which you know that's replaceable. Yeah, I know you ran as The Flash but you could have been The Hulk at times, because we are going to see you get a little bit angry here, you know, we don't, you wouldn't like you when you are angry! Have a look at this... I've seen that sign before, I've gone the wrong way. How have I done it ahhhhhh I've woke up this morning and I've gone east instead of west. And and that's why you should have had a support team, I suppose. We can feel your frustration there because the pain and the agony and the physical exhaustion and the mental exhaustion and then when something like that happens oohhh it hurts, doesn't it? What's worse is that there's no road to go down that was wrong, I was on one road, I just decided to go the other way and continuing along west, it's probably why it hurt so bad. Well, you know that was a low, understandably. Lots of highs as well. Have a look at this one. I think this is it, it's the summit. Who's the daddy? Who's the daddy? Who is the daddy? I'll tell you who the daddy is I'm the daddy, I am the daddy yeahhhhhhh. ugh ugh I just got salt in my mouth! Jamie, will there be Jamie McDonald, the movie? We've got to see it after this, the daddy, the reason was that that was you at the top of The Rockies, as I understand it? That was my final hurdle, it was actually the Coquihalla nicknamed the 'highway of hell'. I was running through a snowstorm. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die but even worse, I got a bucket load of salt and snow! And there's a picture that we are seeing here, and people are thinking what's this claw in this water here, for you, it's your hand that looks quite distorted there and if I've understood this correctly this is the Pacific Ocean, and this is representing you completing that 5,000 mile run, a year on, the equivalent of 200 marathons in 275 days. And then you touched the water, yeah, you put your hand into the Pacific. How did that feel? You know, I just couldn't stop crying. I've been through so much for so long every single day I was running a marathon, in agony, you know and eh I've finally found something, you know, Eamonn, that kind of makes a difference to other people's lives and so I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop even though I wanted to, every every single day and I made it and I dreamt about that moment of putting my hand in the Pacific Ocean. And I done it, it was the best moment of my life. Well, you've done it, not just for your life but lots and lots of children's lives and you chose children's charities. Tell people why you chose children's charities, please, and how much you raised. You know I spent the first nine years of my life, most of the time, in hospital. I've got a condition called syringomyelia. So symptoms as a kid, sometimes I wouldn't be able to move my legs, I had an immune deficiency, the list goes on and on and if it wasn't for the children's hospitals that helped me out as a kid I might not be here so this was my way of giving back to the UK hospitals, The Pied Piper Appeal and GOSH but also out in Canada. So far I've raised about £120,000. And you are still looking for donations and money and people can get you on your website and your Twitter page and all that sort of thing. Yeah, if people go to www.jamiemcdonald.org that's where you can donate and you can also follow the journey on Twitter @MrJamieMcDonald. It's still not quite over; I'm going to do a little fun run on the island and probably drink a beer every single mile! Well, no one deserves it more than you, my friend. Can I just ask you, when are you coming home, Gloucester's home yeah? It is, yeah. I'm going to be home on 11th February. So it looks like Gloucester are doing a bit of a welcome home party, with the Gloucester Cathedral and the Gloucester rugby players are going to be getting involved so it's going to be a load more 'man tears' all over again! Well, Gloucester I'm sure are very, very proud of you. Number one son at the moment. Just do us a favour, maybe just take an aeroplane home, like normal people, you know, you don't have to do anything extraordinary. Just jump on a plane. Come home, see you 13th February, the day before Valentine's Day. He is Jamie McDonald. Very good meeting you, Jamie, a huge success, fantastic! Bye bye. Absolutely brilliant, thank you...\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted us to discuss the topic of tattoos and piercings, and, more specifically, whether they are seen as taboos in your society. Now, a taboo is something which usually has a negative connotation. It's sometimes even forbidden from a society or a group because of the bad associations that are connected with it. Now, in Britain, in the 19th century, tattoos and piercings were actually seen as a taboo. A lot of the people who had these were either sailors, pirates, criminals, prisoners and people of a lower social class, so they were seen to be rebellious and going against the norms in society. But now we're living in the 21st century and that has all changed. The bad reputation that tattoos and piercings used to have no longer really exists that much in Britain. Pretty much anyone and everyone can have a tattoo, old and young, of any social class, any age, any background, really. Samantha Cameron, our ex-prime minister David Cameron's wife, actually has a tattoo on her ankle and I think that is quite unexpected for a lot of people. I personally don't have any tattoos, but when I was a little bit younger I had quite a lot of piercings. I think I had something like fourteen or sixteen in total and those were a lot of piercings on my ears and also a couple on my body. And I remember when I was going through this phase of wanting lots of piercings, my mother, like, was completely confused. She didn't understand at all why I really liked piercings. And I think the reason why is because we come from two different cultures. So my mum was born and raised in Gambia, West Africa, and I have lived my entire life, or the majority of my life, in the UK, in Britain. So, in Britain, like I said, in the 21st century, piercings and tattoos have become a form of self-expression. It's a way that we express our personality and our character, the same way that we use our clothes to do that. So, when I was fifteen at the time and I wanted all these piercings, I was actually trying to form an identity for myself. Perhaps even without knowing. And I think I really liked the idea of being alternative and a little bit rebellious and different, I guess. But the society that my mum comes from, their understanding and relationship with piercings and tattoos is completely different. She comes from a society and a culture that is more conservative perhaps, and also a generation that is more conservative, and their idea of identity is not related to piercings and tattoos. Identity comes from your family background, erm, which ethnic group you belong to, so it's very different from Britain, where we can use our clothes, our hairstyle, the colour of our hair, piercings, tattoos and even our car to express our identity. I think how tattoos and piercings are perceived in different cultures and the purpose they serve in different cultures is really interesting. In some ancient cultures it was believed that tattoos actually had healing powers, so, you know, it's so interesting to see how a tattoo and piercing can be a taboo in one culture and it can be completely normal and acceptable in another. I'm very interested to hear what you all have to say on the topic. Do any of you have piercings or tattoos? Are tattoos and piercings seen as taboos in your society? And what do you personally think about piercings and tattoos? Comment below, let me know, and I'll see you in the next one. Goodbye!\n",
            "He's only fourteen and whilst most his mates love football, Jack Moule is more of a water-boy wonder. Because football isn't his thing - jetskiing is. I've found that jetskiing I can meet great people and really enjoy, like, the people, and really enjoy the sport. And if you do a trick wrong or do something wrong, people won't shout at you and the only person that's mad at you is yourself, really. A lot of adrenaline as well, I imagine. Yeah, yeah, of course. With this 22-stone jetski going over the top of your head, yeah, you don't really want it landing on you, so yeah, you've got to let, get a lot of adrenaline rush from it. He became UK freestyle champ, putting clear water between him and his nearest rival. There's three different types of tricks: there's above-the-water, on-the-water and below-the-water. A* above-the-water trick is called a barrel roll where you do a 360 twist in the air and land exactly the same way. A* on-top-of-the-water is a bulldog or on top of the hood where you're kind of on the side of the jetski and you can do 180 and 360 spins on it. And a below-the-water trick is a sub where you bounce the seat up into the air, tuck your legs in and then you go under the water, and you can come up facing the other way. The UK championships is just the start for Jack. His ambition is to make a splash on a bigger stage. My future is to go to the world finals in Arizona, in America, and compete against the best in the world, really. Have you ever had any really scary moments doing this? When I first started trying barrel rolls, at one point I was upside-down and I let go of it, by an accident, and yeah, that was pretty sketchy. It almost hit me. Jack's friends say he's flipping mad, but he's also flipping good. Alistair Bunkall, Sky News, Buckinghamshire.\n",
            "'If you're happy clap along if you feel that happiness is the truth.' Hey, guys, my name is Asha and this video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens online magazine and YouTube channel. OK, I just wanted to start off by saying there's a lot of things that are happening in the world... 2016/2017 which is a bit like ... which may make you question some people's decisions about things and make you say things like, 'Really, are you being serious?' And I felt the need to make a positive video despite all the things that are happening. So here are ten things that make me personally smile and hopefully you guys will relate to some of them. Number one is that chocolate exists and how can chocolate not make you smile? Number two is blue skies and sunshine. It just makes me smile when it's bright outside even when I need to wake up at 7a.m. Number three would be watching something funny on YouTube. Have you guys seen that video where that guy's like, 'I've got an apple I've got a pen I've got a apple pen ' or something like that. Guys, you should check that out. It's so funny. Number four. This one's a bit cheesy but it is hanging out with my family and friends and spending like really good, quality time. Like, it makes me smile when I'm, like, surrounded by good people. Number five is going on holiday. Sun, sea and sand are my favourite three Ss because when I'm abroad I'm like. Ooh, I know. Number six is when the top you really wanted goes on sale and you get it for half the price. I'm legit like, 'Oh yeah oh yeah ' Number seven is it makes me smile that filters have been invented. Like, even when you've woken up, you can just stick a Snapchat filter on and make yourself look like a cute little dog and you're sorted. Number eight is warm, home-baked cookies. I'm smiling all day after one of them. I feel like I've been mentioning a lot of food but food makes me smile. The ninth reason to smile is those days when you do not even need to set an alarm and you can snooze all day long with no worries in the world, just you, yourself and a beautiful dream about Theo James or whoever your celebrity crush is. And number ten on things that make me smile is when you guys like, comment, subscribe! I really could not help myself there, but make sure if you did like this video to give it a thumbs up, comment down below what makes you smile and do not forget to subscribe. And I will see you in the next video.\n",
            "Hey, guys! My name is Asha and this video is for British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and YouTube channel. So, today has made me realise how much of a grown-up I am now. I do my own washing, I pay bills and I am trying to find a full-time job currently, which has really made me miss being a child, slash, teenager. So, I thought I would take this opportunity and make this video and to express how much I miss being a child, slash, teenager. OK, let's start with the most important, yet, like, biggest thing you do not realise when you are younger, and that is your parents and how much they do for you, whether that is cleaning, washing, making you food. The most important one: restocking the fridge. The amount of times I have gone into the kitchen and thought, 'Why do I not have any cheese?', and that's because I haven't been to the supermarket in ages. That is the most important and probably the one that I miss the most about being a child. Another thing I miss a lot is seeing my friends at school every single day. I just miss those days you go to school and you just see your friends, every single day. You eat lunch with them, every single day. You go and play out with them, every single day. So, I do miss that. OK, this one is super sad but I just can't help it, but I miss being excited for things like Christmas and my birthday. It was always events where I was like, counting the days down, like, twenty-four days until my birthday, twenty-three days. Like, my birthday is next month and, honestly, I could not tell you how many days are left. And I remember back in the day, I would have a full-on countdown for events like this. So, it makes me sad that I can't get myself excited about it any more. I also miss probably paying for child tickets for theme parks, public transport. The price difference between an adult ticket and a child ticket is just, is just like, that difference in money is huge. Sometimes I just want to get on somewhere and be, like, yeah, I'm a child still, please. Please. And lastly, I miss just generally going to the park. When I go and I meet my friends it always involves money, whether it's going to the cinema, going to town, going somewhere to eat. There is money involved. I miss those days where we could be happily at the park, enjoying ourselves on the swings and, yeah, I just I really miss childhood so much. Anyway, these are a few things that I personally miss being a child, slash, teenager. Comment down below what you miss about childhood, slash, teenagehood, and if you are a teenager comment down below what you love about being a teenager and what you will probably miss. But otherwise, do not forget to subscribe and I will see you in the next video. Bye!\n",
            "So that's enough anyway about why I think writing a blog is a great thing to do. If you have been convinced, then now is the time to share those tips of how to go about actually starting your blog. So, the first thing you're going to want to do is sign up to a blog publishing service, and the first-ever service that I used was blogger.com, which I think is run by Google, and it's absolutely free to sign up. It's very easy to use. It's a very it has a very simple format, so I would definitely recommend that site. Erm, it still exists! If you are new to blogging and you're not too confident with, like, gadgets and different layouts, it's a very simple layout. What I now use is a website called Wordpress and, again, you can sign up for Wordpress free of charge, and then if you are invested in blogging and you want to personalise the layout of your blog or you want to have your own domain, your own name for your website, then you can add on those extra things later on. But I would say to start off with, I would just go with a free domain, a free sign-up, because you're probably just trying out blogging. You might not actually like it, and that's absolutely fine! But I think it's better to start off with something free rather than invest a lot of money into it, and then see if you like it. So now that you've got yourself a log-in, you'll want to actually start designing your blog, and this is the fun part - at least for me, I think it's fun. So, the first thing I would recommend is obviously choosing a name for your blog, and a name - although it might seem like a small thing - is actually very important, because it's how people will search you, it's how people will find you and it's the first thing people will see when they access your blog. So, that might be the thing that encourages them to stay, or they might be, like, 'I'm not interested.' And what I would recommend, if you are thinking of a name, is to choose something that reflects the content that you're posting on your blog. So, for example, if your name is Sammy and you like cooking, you could write or you could choose the name, I don't know, 'Sammy's cookbook' or 'Sammy's secret recipe'. So, as soon as someone logs on to your blog, they'll know exactly what your blog's about. If, like me, you might want to write about multiple topics, then I would recommend rather than choosing a name that incorporates the content of what you're blogging about, I would perhaps just use your name, because otherwise it might be a bit too much information. So, I write about travelling, I write about books, I write about just my thoughts about many different things happening, so there's not very it's not a very consistent theme all the time. So, what I've done, to cater for all the different types of things that I write about, is just to use my name so that people know it's me who's writing. It's easy to search me on Google. When it comes to actually writing your blog, I would really stress being as consistent as possible, because if you don't post for a very long time, then people might lose interest in your blog. They might stop following it. I would say try and set a schedule of when you're going to post. Erm, perhaps every week or even every two weeks is a bit too much to start off with, so maybe start at once a month and then if you feel that you have a lot of content that you can offer, that you have the time to blog - because blogging is also quite time-consuming - then you can reduce that to every two weeks, every three weeks, so that you have content coming out regularly and people are staying engaged with your blog. And my last tip would be to share your blog with your friends and family, and I know this can be daunting, especially if you are just starting your blog. When I first started my YouTube channel, I was a bit embarrassed to tell my friends and also my family. But honestly I think they're more likely than not to be very supportive of what you're doing, and you'll really need that support when you're first starting out because, erm, you obviously won't have a very big following, so your friends and your family are going to be your number-one fans right at the beginning. They're going to help you share your blog with their friends and family, and they're going to help you attract the right kind of people, who are interested in the content you're producing. So those are my tips for starting out your first blog. I hope that they were useful and, if they were, please make sure to share this with your friends or family members who might also be interested in writing or starting up their own blog as well, so that everyone can benefit from this video. If you do have any tips yourself, then comment below and we can share that with our online community as well. That's all I guess I have for today, so with that, happy blogging! And I'll see you in the next one. Bye, guys!\n",
            "Welcome back! My name's Sophia and this video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to share some useful tips for learning a new language. As a language student I completely understand that sometimes it can be difficult, especially if you're teaching yourself a language from home by yourself and you're not attending any classes. It can be discouraging and you can be a bit lost as to what to do. Whether you're a complete beginner or you're looking to improve your language foundation, I'm hoping that this video will be useful in encouraging you all on your language journeys. So, I myself am learning French at home by myself. I don't go to any classes or I don't have any extra help besides the internet and some books that I have. So, a great website that I'm using at the moment to learn French vocabulary is called Memrise and the idea behind Memrise is really cool. Basically, each word is a seed that you plant and every day you need to water the seed so that it grows into a beautiful flower and once it's grown big enough then it moves into the greenhouse or your long-term memory. And, the website is really good, it's free. All you need is an email account and you can set yourself daily goals, you can do timed activities and you can just keep checking your progress, as well as interacting with other people who are studying the same language as you. You can send them friend requests and you can send them messages. So it's a great website and of course it's free, which is what language should be about. Listening to music and watching TV dramas in your target language is a great way to improve your listening and also speaking skills because you're listening to people speaking in their native tongue and you're also learning the correct accent, so YouTube, of course, is a great platform for this. There are hundreds of songs, hundreds of videos that you can watch, of course, again, for free. If you're watching this video you're already doing this. You're already engaging with your target language, which is great. What I personally like to do is to find YouTubers who talk about things that I'm interested in. So, if you are interested in make-up or fashion, for example, why not try and find a YouTuber who does make-up tutorials or fashion videos in your target language, so that way, you're watching something that you enjoy but you're also learning a language at the same time. Isn't that great? My last tip is to try and read in your target language. Of course, when you're learning any language there are four skills - listening, speaking, reading and writing. So, reading, erm, in your target language will help with your reading and writing skills. Make sure you're reading material which is suited to your level. If you're a beginner and you're reading intermediate material - intermediate books, magazines - that can be very discouraging because it can make you feel like you don't know anything, which isn't true. You're just not reading for your level. So, the British Council has a great website, which of course will be linked below in the description bar, and there are so many different topics to choose from. Again, if you're interested in travelling, in food, in books, whatever it may be, find something that interests you and is targeted to your level. Choose a topic that you're interested in and there is lots of extra reading to be done. So, guys, that's the end of this video. I hope these tips have been useful and perhaps even encouraged you to start learning a new language. Who knows? Please comment below. Let me know what your language-learning tips are, because as ever I'm also always looking to receive some advice and some help. I hope you have a great day and good luck with your language learning. See you in the next one! Bye, guys!\n",
            "Hello and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name is Molly and in today's video I wanted to share some tips and tricks for reading in a foreign language. Tip number one is to read children's books. You might be really keen to read the classics, so, er, Shakespeare or something, but starting with that really isn't a good way to go. If you're a beginner, a children's book is often a much better starting point. They are shorter, they use simple language, they have large font and sometimes they even have pictures. And all of this means that it's a lot easier to get started with reading. For me, I study Spanish and the first book that I read in Spanish was a translation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, which is a British children's classic. And that was a really great decision. Tip number two is to pick a book that you know and love. If you pick a favourite book then you're already going to be familiar with the plot and the characters and so it's going to be a less confusing experience. And, you're also going to save a lot of time because you won't have to keep looking up all these words in the dictionary. For me, um, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and I recently started reading the series in Spanish, which I'm really enjoying. Also, I have here Ciudades de Papel, which is a Spanish translation of John Green's book Paper Towns. I've read this in English and really enjoyed it, um, and also, another thing to say is that for this and for Harry Potter, and for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I've seen the movies, and this is another way to really help yourself because it just adds another level of familiarity to the process. Tip number three is to read a parallel text book. Now, I don't know if you all know what that is, but I have one here, which is, um, this is a collection of poems by Federico García Lorca, but books like this have the original text on one side and the translation on the other. So, this one has, um, you probably can't see it here, but I've got the Spanish poem here and the English translation here. And this also really helps because you don't have to go to a dictionary again because the translation is right there, and you can refer to the translated version as much or as little as you need, er, depending on how good your language is. So, I really do recommend that as well. And my fourth and final tip for you today is to forget books altogether and read articles. Articles are a really great way to start reading because they're so short. And also, um, because they're short, they are so much less of a commitment than a book is. So, they're really easy to fit into your daily routine or your weekly routine or whatever, and just read a couple of articles when you have a spare bit of time. On the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website, for the magazine section, has a whole host of articles, so I'd really recommend going there and checking out some of those as a place to begin. Thanks very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed it and found these tips useful, and I will see you next time. Bye!\n",
            "Hey, guys! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today I'm joined with my mum, Kissu say hello!

She tells sheshe... She sells Sorry. I did not see. It's too small. Let me zoom in. There you go. OK. She sells she shells by the she shore. She shore? Haha. OK. She sells seashells by the seashore.

Don't you guys think so too? Anyway, comment below. Let us know also what was the hardest one, and which one was your favourite one. I hope you're having a great day and see you in the next video!

            "Hello and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name's Molly and this weekend I'm coming to Manchester to visit a friend, so I thought it would be fun to take you along with me and show you what I get up to. We went to a café for lunch called Common, in the Northern Quarter, which was really nice. And now we've come over to Castlefield, which is another part of Manchester, and we're going to go to, er, Castlefield Gallery, which should be fun. Hey, guys. So, it's the next morning now. I just had brunch with my friends, which was really nice. It's a lovely sunny day here in Manchester and we were even able to eat outside, which was really nice for November in England! And now we're on the way to visit the People's History Museum in central Manchester, so I will update you later. So I'm back home and back from Manchester now, but I just wanted to update you about the rest of my trip. So, we went to the People's History Museum - erm, it was really interesting - and then we spent the rest of our time wandering around the Christmas market. Er, there was a lot of delicious food and drink and the atmosphere was really Christmassy and festive. I had a really fun time in Manchester and I loved taking you along with me - I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you so much for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in my next video. Bye!\n",
            "While some use vicious weapons to dispatch prey, others employ the finesse of a marksman. The archer fish uses a water pistol. It makes a gun barrel by pressing its tongue against a groove in its mouth. It closes its gills to force out the water. It's accurate up to two metres. This expert in ballistics even allows for the curving of the jet through gravity and adjusts for the way light bends at the boundary between water and air, which appears to shift the position of its target. By some amazing computation, it changes its firing angle to compensate for this optical illusion. Archers target anything that moves or glows. The velvet worm employs even deadlier firepower. One of the oldest invertebrates, its shooting style is unique. Like a gunslinger, it has two pistols. They fire lassos of glue. The threads snake up to a metre. Its glue guns weave from side to side to spread their fire. The strands glue down the victim like a sticky net. This rapid adhesive dries in seconds. The velvet worm's knife-like jaw pierces its victim before sucking it dry.\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk about some weird things that we do in Britain. So, I have been thinking about this a bit because I have been talking to some of my friends who have moved to Britain to study for university and they've just been, like, 'You know what? It's really weird that British people do.' So it got me thinking about these things that people brought to my attention because as a British person, it just seems like the norm because obviously I've grown up in Britain and it's all I've ever known, but the more I think about it, and just reflect on different places I've travelled to, the more I realise that these things actually are very British. So, without further ado, here are some weird things that British people do. Now the first one probably goes without saying. It's a very big stereotype about British people but it is based in truth - that we are very serious about our cups of tea. Tea-drinking is a very big thing in Britain. We have tea houses, um, lots of shops popping up in London that specialise in different types of brewed tea and all this kind of, like, intricate stuff to do with tea. It's an art, it's becoming an art, tea-drinking, it really is. Knowing how to make the perfect cup of tea. There are even courses on this. Would you believe it? Now, I would say I'm very traditional in the sense that I do have at least one cup of tea a day. It's not always, like, Earl Grey or 'English' tea but I definitely do have a cup of tea, whether it's, like, summer time, whether it's winter time. I always have at least a cup of tea around four, five o'clock, when it's teatime. But I do know that there are British people who take this much more seriously than I do, and can drink up to ten cups of tea a day. I actually have a friend who is guilty of this, so tea is a very important thing for British culture. I don't know if it's weird, but it is very particular to British culture. The next thing is something very small but something very different for quite a lot of countries. In our bathrooms we tend to have separate hot water and cold water taps. In Europe generally, um, the taps are those mixer taps so it means that you just, like, move it to the left if you want it to be hot and move it to the right if you want it to be cold. Put it somewhere in the middle and you get perfect lukewarm water. In the UK, or at least, um, in a lot of more traditional old-build houses in the UK, we have two separate taps, so to create that lovely lukewarm water we have to dilute the two taps. I'll put a picture in because I actually have it in my, um, house, so you can see what I'm talking about. It's something so simple that you might not even notice, but something that can be a bit weird if you are coming to the UK for the first time and you're staying in a house that has these two different taps. So the next weird thing that we do in Britain is that we drive on the left-hand side of the road. And I know we're not the only ones to do this. I know that in Cyprus they also drive on the left and I think in Malta as well. But I took this one step further to figure out why we drive on the left-hand side of the road, because I couldn't just settle with the fact that we wanted to be different from the rest of the world or we wanted to be more difficult than the rest of the world in driving on this side. So, what I found from doing a quick Google search is that apparently in the medieval times it was more common to actually ride your horse on the left-hand side of the road, and this is because, of course, most people are right-handed, not just writing but also I guess with sword-fighting. So knights or men who rode horses with swords would have to have their right side ready and armed just in case someone was going to attack them or they needed to engage in a fight. So, it does make sense. It's weird, but it does make sense, why we drive on the left-hand side of the road. Returning back to bathrooms for just one sec, another weird thing that we do in Britain is sometimes we have carpets on our bathroom floor. Now, this could be seen as a good thing and a bad thing, or maybe just a weird thing. I don't find it weird just because I've been to a couple of my friends' houses that have carpet in their bathroom and it's actually really nice during the winter. I feel like it would keep your feet nice and warm when you've just got out of the shower. But it is kind of weird to have carpet in your bathroom the more I think about it. But again, I think more modern houses probably don't have this as much any more, but more traditional houses have those two little taps we talked about and perhaps carpet in your bathroom. Why not? Another thing which my friend actually pointed out to me, and I had never really thought about this before, is that we use these washbowls - I'm not even sure what they're actually called - but we have basically a big bowl that you put in the sink and you fill that with hot water and soap and you wash your bowls in there, so you're not refilling the sink with hot water or you're not letting the water run while you're washing. It's a great way to save water and soap when you're washing plates, but it's something I didn't realise that was quite particular to Britain. I actually went into the shop the other day and I saw them selling these, so I was, like, wow, it actually is a big thing. I wasn't sure if it was something that just my family did to save water and soap or if it was, like, a widespread thing, but actually it's quite a common thing, I would say, to use these washbowls to wash your plates and then rinse them all off at the end. The next thing that could be seen as a weird thing that we do in Britain is that our lawyers and our judges still wear those white powdered wigs to the courtroom. And I actually again tried to do a quick Google search to figure out the history about this and, like, why we still do this, but essentially it's just a uniform, I guess. I mean, I feel like when you watch any crime or, like, law court series or dramas, British ones particularly, you always see that token lawyer or judge with that powdered wig. Most of the searches came up with it saying that it's just a uniform nowadays. I find it weird - I don't understand why, um, but there we have it. That's another weird thing that we do in the UK. Now, I've mentioned this in a previous video. British people love queuing. And this is seen to be such a weird thing in different countries, especially when I was in Italy. People really don't know what queuing is. People didn't understand why I would get so upset when I'm waiting in a line, or what I think is a line, in the supermarket and then someone just comes in front of me because they have less stuff. But British people absolutely love queuing. I have no idea where this whole, like, social system came from but it is a very concrete one in British society and it's one that you can't ignore. So just be warned. If you ever are in something that looks like a queue, it's best to just wait your turn. Don't go ahead, because you're sure to get someone angry if you do. And my last and final weird thing that we do in Britain is to do with our money, actually. Um, I was looking at a twenty pound note that I had the other day and I realised it said something like 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of twenty pounds on demand'. And it reminded me of this class I had back in primary school when we were looking at the Victorian era as to why our money still says, 'I promise to pay' blah blah blah, when, you know, we have the actual money, and it goes back to, from what I can remember, the fact that people sometimes didn't have the physical money to pay someone so they would literally just write on a piece of paper, like a plain piece of paper, not real money, 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of XXX' and they would swear on the queen's life that they were going to pay this money or this loan to that particular person. So I think it's kind of cool that we still have that on our actual, um, cash notes now. I just thought that was something really cool and different, perhaps a bit weird. Um, I can't remember coming across that anywhere else in all the other currencies I've used during my travels, but let me know if you do have something similar in your currency. Who knows? Maybe we're all weird together. So, guys, I hope you enjoyed this video of a couple of weird things that we do in Britain. Let me know in the comments below how weird these things actually are, because they might actually not be that weird, but this is just what, as I said, some of my friends who have moved to the UK have told me about. They don't seem that weird to me, probably because I've lived in the UK for most of my life, but who knows? I will see you in the next one. Bye, guys!\n",
            "Happy International Women's Day! It's Sophia again and, of course, this video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. As it is International Women's Day, I thought as well as celebrating all the amazing women in our lives, it would be really great to raise some awareness about women's equality, so I'm going to be speaking to you guys today about 'pink tax', otherwise known as gender tax. What is gender tax? Gender tax is basically the idea that women have to pay more for certain products because they're marketed at women and not men. Now you might be thinking, 'How is this possible?' Surely if women across the globe realised that they were being charged more than men, they would be angry and they wouldn't buy the products and they would realise how unfair this is? Unfortunately, no! Gender tax has sneaked into many everyday products that women and men aren't even aware of! We might be familiar with the classic examples of women's deodorants or razors costing more than men's, but have you ever thought about something as simple as a plain T-shirt or a yoghurt? A report by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found on average that products geared towards women cost more than similar products geared towards men 42 per cent of the time. But it doesn't just stop there. Even children are affected by the gender tax. In the same report, they found that these two similar scooters from the same company - one was targeted at girls and one was targeted at boys - and the one that was targeted at girls cost £16 more than that one targeted at boys. So even girls and boys, men and women, people of all ages are affected by the pink tax or the gender tax. So, what can we take from all of this? Well, I think that the very first important step is to be aware of gender tax; to be aware of the products we're buying and to question whether this product is more expensive because it's for a woman or less expensive because it's for a man. You can help to raise awareness by sharing this video with all your family and friends. Leave me a comment below and let me know if you've realised any products in your local supermarket that might be influenced by gender tax, and, of course, let me know how you're celebrating International Women's Day. I hope you're having a lovely day and, once again, happy International Women's Day. I'll see you in my next one! Byeeeeee!\n",
            "Let me take you back to the earliest days of our planet, four and a half billion years ago. At this time, the Earth had no moon. It was orbiting the Sun alone, and it was being assaulted by rocks and comets. Today, there are no scars left from this cosmic pinball but to get a sense of the damage that was done, I've come to the Arizona desert to a great hole in the ground. This is a beautiful crater, a near-perfect circle a mile in diameter. It was formed when a meteor crashed into the Earth a mere fifty thousand years ago. That's nothing on the timescale that we're talking about. But, it's amazing how much damage that one passing rock can cause. The early Earth was bombarded with rocks; it must have been mayhem. And then along came something much, much bigger. Another planet the size of Mars drifted into the path of Earth. It was on a collision course. It hit the Earth with a glancing blow. Imagine the power released by such a collision! The impact sent a mass of liquid rock into orbit. This debris coalesced into a ball and the moon was formed, just fourteen thousand miles away from the early Earth. This was the closest point it could have been. Any closer, and gravity would have pulled the debris crashing back to Earth and there'd be no moon. Today the moon is just a rock, reflecting the sun's light, but back then it was a molten sphere burning brightly. It must have looked amazing: an enormous orange disc in the sky. Imagine the scene, the first moonrise over the early Earth. Our world was no longer alone. It had a huge, powerful neighbour, and ever since this has been a very different type of planet.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Rudi Browning, I'm 15 years old, and I'm a professional drone racer from Brisbane. Drone racing is essentially racing and building drones. I've got a soldering iron and a workshop at home. I've also got a local park near me which I'm often training and building and fixing and racing, so, yeah, it's heaps of fun and I really enjoy it. I qualified for the FAI World Championships in Shenzhen, based on an event that I went to in Sydney. I placed highly in that event, qualifying me for the, er, the race in China. We've got the yellow drone of Australia out in front. The red drone of Latvia in second place. Through the bridge... The race in China had over 127 competitors from 34 different countries, so there was some brutal competition and, er yeah, I'm super happy to have, er, taken away the win. The 2018 championship is for the taking. And he does take it, ladies and gentlemen. Australia! When I crossed the line in first place, I was just so overwhelmed and so happy. Um, so much work and dedication has gone into this racing. I've had a lot of bad luck and er, I feel like that bad luck has made this win even sweeter. Rudi Browning, the champion Back home, er, my parents and a bunch of other friends were watching the livestream on a big TV and apparently it was pretty intense, so, yeah, everyone is super, super happy and, er yeah, a really good result. Drone racing is great for kids, um, from all ages. It's good for like, it's a good family environment, it's a good community and it's really fun. In order to start drone racing, you need a controller, that's what's you, that's what's got the two joysticks, and that's how you control it. You also need a pair of virtual reality goggles, also known as FPV goggles for 'first person view'. That way you can see the camera and what's happening on the drone live and pretty much zero latency, which is amazing. There's heaps of Facebook forums and groups and lots of YouTube videos on how to get into it, and, er yeah, it's really accessible, 'cause, um, the internet's got heaps of information, and, yeah, people are always welcome to help you out. Team Australia step forward... So, er, Team Australia also came first in the team racing event. Korea was some fierce competition; er, I knew it would be close. I'm just so, so happy to have won and I'm so happy it ended the way it did. There's a series called DCL - the Drone Championships League. Um, there's 16 races in eight different countries all around the world, starting in Switzerland, so that's very exciting. Er, Team FPVR and Australia will be representing. It should be really exciting next year and I can't wait to continue with it and see what the future has to hold.\n",
            "If you saw a picture like that online, would you consider giving this person a job? Erm, no. It's not good. I don't know who they are. What do you think of this person by seeing that photo? Snapchat. Kind of annoying. What advice would you give to this person about presenting themselves online? Probably try and mix up the Snapchat filter photos with more normal photos as well. By seeing images like this online, what do you think of this person? I don't know what it says about the personality there. They can't take themselves very seriously. The second one, I'm not quite sure. What do you think about this person and their online image? Disturbing! What would you recommend to this person about improving their online image? To get rid of the childish Snapchat filter. OK. If you saw pictures like this online, would you be more inclined to give this person a job? Yes. She looks a bit smarter. If you saw a picture like this, would you be more likely to employ someone? He looks like someone that can market for my organisation. This person to me would be more employable. Hello. Hello. Is that you? Yeah. Is that you? Are you the other one as well? Yeah. When one of them said that I was a bit childish it kind of hurt a little bit, yeah. It has, it's definitely made me think to be careful what I put up. Is it immature or too silly?

            "Hey, guys. My name's James. I'm a YouTuber by the name Wizzite and I'm here to tell you guys: be careful what you post online because once it's online, it's online forever. Be aware, be safe. I'm Vikkstar123 and my tip for using the internet in a safer way is to be very careful when arranging to meet someone that you know online in person. Never do it alone - you don't know who that person may actually be. What is up? It is Ashley Marie here and my tip for Internet Safety Day is to make sure that your social media profiles are set to private. This ensures your safety. What's up, guys? I'm Pizza from CodeNamePizza and today I've got a little tip for you guys. If you see anything online on the internet that worries you at all, just make sure you do tell a trusted adult. Hey, guys. FragManSaul here, and welcome to my top tip of internet safety! That's right, do not accept friend requests from strangers, guys. You just never know who they are, even if they have a mutual friend. Stay safe. FragMan out. Hello. Online my name is Jake. Well, no, my YouTube channel's different OK, I've already messed this up! Hi there. My name's Josh and I'm from the channel Slogoman on YouTube, where I create gaming and real-life content for people to watch sometimes. My tip for Safer Internet Day is to be smart and protective with your passwords on all of your accounts online. My name is Kelly Jean and I am a streamer on Twitch TV. I play video games and I do cosplay, all whilst live streaming. So, my piece of advice to you guys is: do not tag people in pictures or posts unless you're sure that they will like it. Potentially, other people that you don't know at all will see those tags and that can be a problem if you're trying to be private. So, internet safety: make sure that people online, even if they say one mean thing about you, don't let it get to you because you are who you are and they're the ones who are sitting in their room or just on their phone just being a loser, OK? They're the losers here, not you, all right? Safe. Yeah, that's Yes, yes, yes! CR here. Here is another safety tip: do not ever share personal or inappropriate photographs online because once they are online, they are there for good. You have no control over them and people can and will share them. Make sure to not have the same password for all of your accounts and to have lots of different ones. Make sure to have all sorts of random characters, upper case, lower case, numbers in those passwords to make them super safe. Hey, guys. How are you doing? My name is Alex from the Arekkz gaming YouTube channel and today we're talking about internet safety - more importantly, installing programs. See, sometimes when you install a program, you get your little dialogue box and occasionally hidden in the corner, bottom left, bottom right, somewhere, there might be a little tick box that says, 'Hey, do you want to install this as well?' Let me tell you right now: you never, never want to install the extra stuff because what might take a minute to install will probably take many, many hours to uninstall. Don't just hit 'next', because if you do, you might be installing more than you bargained for. Hello, I'm Tommy and I'm Adam and we are TwoAngryGamersTV and we're here to tell you: don't share your password with anyone. Never. Just not even your closest mate. It's just not worth it. No. Now, what you should also do is put as many different numbers and characters into your password as possible, making it as difficult for those evil computer hackers to get into. So, mine, for instance: d7x247_!x24. You've just told them your password. Oh no! Hey there. My name is Yammy and I run the channel Yammy xox on YouTube. My top tip for internet safety is: don't feed the trolls! It's what they want. Ignoring them and blocking them is always best and, if so be it, report them to the appropriate authorities. And that's the sort of security you need to be ultra-safe on the internet and make sure no one can steal any of your personal information and secrets. Bye!\n",

            "My father always encouraged me in sport so I don't look at this woman-man competition thing. I'm just a surfer and if I feel I want to try it, I'll go out and try it. That's my father, Fred Haslock. That's me. That's me there. That's my brother belly-boarding. These are the wooden surfboards which I first started on in about the 1950s. They're now called belly boards. You just lie on them and catch the wave coming in and it's a way of learning to catch waves. The lifeguards started bringing down the longboards which we called the Malibu boards. So I went with Trevor Roberts and he said you can only surf it if you carry your board. In those days they were very heavy and 10ft long. This is in about 1965 and, er, you note that there's no wetsuits. We didn't have our wetsuits to put on in those days. In a way, it's lovely surfing without a wetsuit. It's freedom. I think people got a bit namby-pamby now, really. My first competition was in 1965, where I was the only lady because there was not a ladies' category so I had to go with the men. I had a competition in about '67 and I was the first ladies' British Champion. I just love the freedom of being out in the sea and going with the flow of the wave. There's nothing like it. Every wave is different. You paddle for it and as soon as you stand up and catch it, you're zooming down on it, to try and flow and go as long as you can and just be one with the wave. I've had some strange looks as I've gone down by younger people. But then as soon as I go out in the water they can see that, yes, I can catch waves and perhaps it encourages them. If there's an older person who can do it, they say, 'Well, look, if she can do it, so can I.' I may not be here much longer so just go out and enjoy it.\n",
            "Before change, there must be analysis. Organisational change is a costly and difficult business, and there must be a real business need reason in order to change current practice. Typically, changes are attempts to reach new markets, to improve productivity or to cope with drastically reduced funding. A good analyst will identify the key problem. Once it's clear what change is required, a change strategy has to be developed. In other words, somebody needs to say what should be done. Sometimes the idea will come from a visionary within the company, perhaps an imaginative and persuasive member of the management team. Otherwise, the company might bring in a consultant to help them find the right solution. Either way, management should also consult with staff at this stage. There should be meetings to help raise awareness for the need for change and to give employees a chance to suggest their own solutions. Next comes what's probably the most problematic stage: implementation. Above all else, making the planned change a reality requires communication. Staff will need to be informed of new procedures and, where necessary, trained in new skills. The most important member of the change management team at this stage is the gatekeeper. It's their job to be available to staff, to help them deal with problems they may be having with the changes and answer any questions, making the change as painless as possible. Finally, there's the consolidation stage. There needs to be a way to collect feedback from employees on how the change is being received. Because there will still be some resistance to the change, even at this stage, someone needs to act as a champion for the innovation. The champion gives encouragement and raises morale by congratulating everyone on a successful changeover and on what's been achieved.\n",
            "I want to talk about supporting Coventry City, the team I've supported since I was a young boy at school. Coventry City are a team from the West Midlands near Birmingham, where I grew up. And just to give a bit of background on the club, it was founded back in 1883, and we were founder members of the Premier League. But in 2001, after 34 consecutive years in the top division, we were finally relegated. And since that year, we've been in the Championship or the second tier of the English Football Leagues. Our only real honour was winning the FA Cup back in 1987. People often ask me why I support Coventry City. Well, in my school, everyone either supported Aston Villa, the local team, or Liverpool, the team that won everything at the time. I didn't really want to support the same as everybody else - I wanted to choose a different team. So after a school trip to Coventry one day, I thought, well, I'll support Coventry City, then. It was the FA Cup win that cemented my support for them. I remember listening to the radio commentary, listening to them beat, I think, Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-final and that was it. I was a City fan then. Erm people ask why I don't support one of the big teams. Well, in England, people either support a team that always wins, and we call them 'glory hunters', or a team near from where they were born. And there is a lot of joy in not supporting one of the big teams, especially when we get to play the big teams. I'll always remember beating Manchester United one cold Boxing Day, when we scored two goals in the last minute to beat them 3-2. And even last season we went to Old Trafford and beat Manchester United 2-0. Also, playing in the Championship is surprisingly a better league, I think, than playing in the Premier League. Every team can beat each other, it's much more exciting, every team has got a chance of getting promoted, or there is always the threat of relegation. Every season, there's new teams to visit and it's much more interesting than the Premier League, which is pretty much the same every year. Supporting a team's like being part of a family: you can't just choose to leave the family if there's some disappointments. And being part of that family means that you share the same dreams and the same desires, and the same disappointments. This season I think we've got a good chance of promotion - we've got a good manager, Chris Coleman, who used to be in charge of Fulham. And we've got an outside chance, I think, of making the playoffs. Last season we were very nearly relegated, but this season I think we'll have a much better season.\n",
            "Hey, you guys, I've been looking for you. I've got an idea - a study group. What do you think? Are you interested? Yes! I need a study group, in a big way. Me too. Do you think we have enough people here for a study group? I mean, there are only four of us Sorry. Three of us. Chris can't do study group. Right, Chris? Yeah, there's no way I can do a study group. I have an assignment and then I'm too busy. But I'll stay for this first meeting. Should we try and get another group together with us for this? No, I don't think so. I think three is fine. Ideal size, really. Me too. OK, three people then. Four people for the first meeting. What next? What about a meeting place? We can't meet here in the library It's not too bad, especially if those other people would go away. But we can't exactly ask them to leave, and people might get annoyed with us talking. Can I say something here? Sure, go ahead. There's a study hall next to the cafeteria. It's almost always empty. Could we meet there? A study hall?! Who knew? Well, it sounds good to me. Yeah. I've never been there but So, we ought to decide how long for and how often. I read somewhere that you should make the meeting at the same time each week. Like a seminar. That way we'd take it more seriously. We may as well make it for this time since we're all here. Is this time OK? Works for me. Me too. Hang on just a minute. I know I'm not going to be in this group, but aren't we supposed to have a seminar at this time every other week? Umm, no. Thursday, no? No, that's on Thursday. Sorry. Forget I said anything. Don't worry about it. So everyone agrees that this time is fine? Every week? How long should we make it? An hour? Could we find a way of making it two hours? Two hours seems a bit like too much. To start with then? Ninety minutes? Compromise? Is that OK with you, Dina? Fine by me. OK, so I guess all we have left to decide is exactly what we'll do when we meet. The final exam is a way off. I guess we could review our notes, or practise learning things by heart. I have a list of dos and don'ts actually that I got online. I could be a moderator, and we could use the ideas as a starting point B2_creating_a_study_group\n",
            "Shamefully, the answer is yes. Growing up, I most definitely posted mean things online. Sometimes about complete strangers, sometimes about people I went to school with, and then other times, even about my friends! I've definitely sent messages whereby, maybe an hour later, I've thought, hmm, should I have said that? And there are definitely things that I have said since then, which maybe years later I thought, hmm, I'm not, I'm not really happy with that. I commented, 'This is the worst art, you're very rubbish', just being really mean. Not necessary, not needed. Normally it was like an in-joke, or something that happened at school, or, you know, something that we'd been talking about. The person commented back, saying that I'd really hurt their feelings. I started crying because I felt so guilty for saying such mean things. If you ever post anything online that you do feel worried about, please make sure you talk to a trusted adult or maybe you might even want to talk to your friend. It's all about how you deal with those things afterwards. You know, apologise to the person that you may have upset. Don't comment mean things that you wouldn't say to someone in person. If it's somebody that you know, let them understand why you did it. If it was a joke, you know, it's not an excuse but at least you're offering some kind of explanation. Online life can be filled with loads of different surprises, but, remember, should anything throw you off, you can talk to an adult you trust or you can check out tips and advice from Own It.\n",
            "Hey, guys. My name is Asha and I wanted to start this video off with a question. Are Disney movies for kids, for families or can adults watch them on their own without no kids? I only ask this because my friend was like, 'I refuse to go to cinemas to watch Moana. It's gonna be full of kids and there's gonna be no adults. It's embarrassing.' I personally think Disney movies are for all ages. I was like, 'No, no, there are adults that still love Disney movies and would go to the cinemas to watch it', also known as people like me. I know my mum secretly loves Disney movies, and don't even get me started on my dad. He loved Disney movies over Christmas. He would even record the end of the movie if he thought he was gonna miss it 'cause he had to go out or go to work. I feel I can get just as much emotion in a Disney movie than any other kind of movie, like, probably even more. I have three top favourite Disney movies that I can recall that I've watched a million times. Number one is definitely Lion King. I love Lion King - I love the songs in there. The Lion King songs literally make you wanna dance and be like, 'The circle of life ' I probably shouldn't sing on camera. I apologise. I just love the emotion that I got from that movie. I probably cried more at The Lion King than I did in a movie like Titanic. You know, I still think I'm not over Mufasa's death. That and Dobby dying is probably the most closest I've got to crying. Number two is definitely Lilo & Stitch. Oh my gosh, how cute is Lilo!? I just think, 'aaaaah'! Again, I love the songs, but I do love the message behind Lilo & Stitch. I like the fact that that movie talks about family love rather than the princess-trying-to-find-her-prince kind of storyline. What's that saying in that movie called? I forgot. Oh my god! What is it? Considering how many times I've seen the movie you would think that I would know it off by heart without googling it, but I'm gonna cheat. Here we go. 'Ohana means family. Family means nobody is left behind or forgotten.' Oh my god, I really think that is the cutest saying ever. I want it, like, painted on my wall: 'Ohana'. And my third favourite Disney movie would probably be Mulan, just because I would love to be her. So, yeah, that is why she is gonna be my third favourite. Like, I could honestly watch Disney movies over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over again! Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this video for LearnEnglish Teens magazine and their YouTube channel. I honestly find that the hardest thing to say! But please remember to, like, comment and subscribe and I will see you in the next video.\n",
            "Merry Christmas, FoodTube! I'm Charlie from Jamie's food team. Here are my top three thrifty decorating tips. Popcorn tinsel easy, fun and cheap! So, bowl, caster sugar, mixed spice and just mix it up! Popcorn, popped, and give that a good cover up. Also going to make my tinsel a little bit more colourful with some dried cranberries and now I'm going to thread it. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can do any pattern you want. You can do long ones, you can do short ones. So there we go. Popcorn cranberry tinsel. Have a go! Dried fruit My favourite decorating tip is dried fruit. Put your oven on. Start slicing. You could probably dry out most fruits using this method. If you don't have a non-stick baking tray then use some baking parchment. Then place your fruit just straight on. Just pop them in the oven for two to three hours, a hundred degrees centigrade, two hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Look how beautiful they are! Ribbon and just poke them through. Tie a knot. This is so easy, so easy and really, really nice. I'm just going to hang that on the tree. I think they look prettier than baubles. Or you could go to do garlands and rather than hanging them on the tree you could hang them around your fireplace, up your banisters, just around pictures or mirrors. Really, really pretty! Napkin rings Why not make your own napkin rings? I'm going to use just these little chillies, a couple of rosemary sprigs. Just get a little bit of thread and you are just tying them together. Find a lovely piece of ribbon. Tie your string. Just a couple of knots. So there we go, you just need to attach it to my napkin. Tie it round. Really colourful napkin holders.

            "Psychology professor John Pilley was interested in finding out how many words a dog can learn and seven years ago he found the perfect student, Chaser. Using crate loads of toys, John and his colleagues devised a groundbreaking study of canine intelligence. The toys all have names that Chaser has learned throughout her life and John picks eight at random. Chase, let's play some. Chase, find Punt. Go get Punt. Bring Papa Punt. Do it, girl, do it. Yeah, good girl! Chase, find Roach. Find Roach. Find Roach. I want Roach. Good girl! John never looks at the toys on the mat, so to pick the right object Chaser has to actually understand what he's saying. Yeah, there's, wow. In tub, in tub. In three years of intensive training, Chaser has learned an astounding 1,022 words. That's 116 balls, 26 Frisbees and over 800 cloth animals. But how does she do it? On the mat are five items Chaser knows and one new one she has never seen, a cat that John calls Meow. Chase, find Meow, find Meow. Find Meow. Do it, girl. Do it. Do it. Do it, girl. Bring it to Papa. This task involves highly complex logic. The new word isn't in Chaser's vocabulary, so she has to understand that it might refer to an unfamiliar object. Chase, get Meow. I want Meow. Do it, girl. Do it. Right now. The way to solve the puzzle is by a process of elimination. Get Meow. Do it, do it. There's Meow. Come here, come here. That's good, good girl, good girl. Good girl, good girl. After only one trial, the new toy and the sound 'Meow' are lodged in her brain. Watch Meow, catch Meow. Good girl! And it just goes to show that you can teach an old dog new tricks!\n",
            "Obviously, this is the sequel to Fun in the City, which is a film I didn't like so it's fair to say my expectations were low. So, you could say I wasn't disappointed, as it met my expectations. It was awful! It was so awful, I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it. But, that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you wasting your money going to see it. So, it starts off with this big wedding scene. And, I won't go into why, but the whole scene is just there so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke... it's just, ah, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then, instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all her friends. It's what directors do when they've run out of ideas let's take our characters on tour! Anyway, they gossip, cry and shop, and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Don't go and see it, you'll only encourage them to make another sequel. The world doesn't need three of these films. Please save your money and go and see the other big film this week: Twilight Mirror. So, if you're a fan of the book it's based on, you're probably as excited as I was about this. For everyone else, this is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. I have to confess, I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them at all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cast either. So I went in not sure what to expect. But I loved it. One thing I really liked about it was the pace. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really well. The special effects brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But, more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters. The whole film worked on so many levels. It reminded me of going to the cinema as a child - how much fun that was. I can't recommend it enough.\n",
            "Parkour has recently exploded across Britain as a new, unique sport for young people. The Professional Parkour community continues to be a great inspiration for the next generation. If you want help, you can get your friends to help you. And try not to touch the ground. Come on Luke, come on. Grab the rail. It's open to all, it challenges me, it doesn't require much equipment. I can do it for any length of time, I can scare myself, I can challenge myself physically. I can learn a hundred different skills just by learning one jump. When I'm high it's a mix-up of afraid and really happy. I just generally like climbing, jumping and that sort of stuff. Pushing limits and things like that. I really like it 'cause it's kind of like me. None of my other hobbies really were. All my other friends think I'm, like, really good, but I'm not actually that good. I really liked it once when we were in Oval and then Alex hung us upside down from a building. We had another coach here to help and they each held one of our ankles and we hung off a building.

            "Hi, how are you? I haven't seen you in class for a while. Good, thanks. You? Great, as long as I don't think too hard about all the essays I have to write this term! Yeah Hey, are you OK? I have to admit, I'm struggling a bit. Maybe even a lot. I've not been sleeping well at all and then I can't concentrate. And all these things are just going around and around in my head. Mmm that doesn't sound good. So, you're sleeping badly and you can't concentrate. Is that all it is, do you think? Well, if I'm honest, it's more than that. I'm starting to dread going outside. I find myself worrying about stupid things like what if I forget the way home. Or, what if I go to class thinking it's Monday but actually it's Friday and I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. It sounds even more stupid when I say it out loud. It took me two hours to leave the house today. It doesn't sound stupid at all. It actually sounds a lot like me last year. Really? But you're so together! I've learned to be, but even I still have bad days. I used to have panic attacks and everything. When you were trying to leave the house today, how did you feel? Like I couldn't breathe. And my heart was going way too fast. Hmm that sounds like a panic attack to me. I thought I was going to die. You'd be surprised how common they are. Loads of people have them, they just don't talk about it. How did you get over them? I actually talked to a doctor about it, and you should too. But I learned some practical things as well. Though they're easier said than done, and they're going to sound weird, so hear me out, OK? OK So, one thing I did was to try to reduce the power of the anxiety and the panic attacks when they came. So - and this may sound strange - at a time when you're feeling safe and OK, you literally do things that make your heart start racing faster and your breathing speed up. Like spinning around on a chair until you're dizzy or hyperventilating so you're short of breath. That sounds awful! It is, but it means you get used to the symptoms, so they feel less scary. Right. Then you have to deliberately do the things that usually make you feel panic. So, if it's going to class on Monday and being scared you've got the wrong day, on Monday you go to class. If you let the anxiety control you by making you stay at home, it just makes it worse the next time you really do have to go out. And what did you do if a panic attack came anyway? I had a distraction plan. So, I walked everywhere instead of taking the bus because the exercise helped, but also I did things like count trees or red cars or something. Whatever it was didn't matter, as long as I had something else to focus on. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I thought\n",
            "We're making cookies. We're making cookies, but we're not even turning the oven on! I can't tell you how excited this recipe makes me! My giant one-pan cookie is deliciously gooey - the easiest you'll ever make and so much fun. We are going to fry, like, really slowly fry, our cookie in a frying pan. I'm not even going to turn the oven on. The secret to making this is, be prepared. For this foolproof dough, grab one bowl for dry ingredients, another for wet. I've got my egg. Going to crack that straight in there. Almond extract. And then vanilla extract. Give it a whisk and we're already on to the dry, starting with 225g of plain flour, half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and half a teaspoon of salt and then we're kind of ready. This is the bit that I love about making these cookies, because you get that instant warm cookie. So let's put that cooker on - 150g of unsalted butter, straight in. And then you want to melt that butter down. Have your smallest ring on a low heat. Adding soft brown sugar just makes for a chewier cookie dough. It seems absolutely bonkers to do it in a frying pan, but it saves time. Firstly, it's one big giant cookie. You know, I'm not having to make up a big cookie dough batter and then dividing it up and then using a baking tray, getting it in the oven - all in one frying pan. If I'm doing less washing up, I'm a happy girl. Just add your dry ingredients and simply bring together. Look at that - that's already starting to look like cookie dough. All you've got to do is add our egg, but just be a little bit speedy when you're doing this, but can you see, can you see it happening? Cookie dough in your frying pan! The quickest cookie dough you'll ever make - done! And now, my instant chocolate chips. Every single time, it's these lovely colourful chocolate sugar-coated pieces. And I'm just going to dot them around. Look at that! That is what every single cookie in the whole wide world should look like. This makes me so happy. Here's that point where you're like, 'Nadiya, stop. Just stop!' There's no more space left on the cookie but you keep going. And there genuinely is no more space left. Stop. OK, put them down. Right, so stick that on a low heat, and I'm going to go about my business and there will be a fully cooked, warm cookie in 20 minutes. You're welcome! My speedy, scrummy, colourful cookie - great fun, whether you're big or small. Come and have a look at what I've made you. Ooh! Look! Cookie! Cookie! Can I smell it? It smells a bit chocolate and vanilla. It's going to be chewy. Shall I cut it? Like a pizza. Oh, look at that, guys! It's a little bit magical, right? It's like a rainbow. The word cook has been put in cookie. That's what we did, we put the cook into cookie! It's just so gooey and nice in the middle. Mummy, look at the chocolate - it's melting. You make, like, a giant cookie and you, like, get a massive pan. Are you going to get a wok and we can... Yeah, yeah. Could you get a wok pan? We've got that pan that's, like, that big. We could fry it in that! And then make a massive one that big!\n",
            "My experience of Shakespeare In Zimbabwe where I had my formative years, so that's to say I was born there and lived there until I was twelve years old, we always heard Shakespearean lines or Shakespearean words spoken without realising that they were actually Shakespearean words and Shakespearean lines. So 'All that glitters is not gold' is something that, you know, we would say. 'Constant as the Northern Star' is something that we would say. 'To be or not to be' is something that we would say. Because our culture, our Zimbabwean culture is so full of proverbs and words and exciting word play. So we grew up around that. And I have to say that it's only years later that I realised that a lot of what we were speaking as young children was actually Shakespeare. And then of course Romeo and Juliet is something that we did at school very early on. And I fell in love with the story of these two young people who were just like myself, young and growing up. The Story of Hamlet I think it starts off very simply. It starts off with someone returning. So I think as an audience we then think, well, just naturally where has he been and what has happened since he has gone. And then we find out you have a king who has been killed by his brother so that the brother can take o­ver the kingdom. But we find out in many different ways. So there's a spiritual finding out, the ghost comes, you know, something unexpected, something from the other realm. And then there's also reason. Hamlet seeing things for himself. And then Hamlet encountering each person who he left behind, because he's been somewhere else. So, you know, there's Polonius who has his own motives and his own family. You have his mother who has her own motives and has made certain decisions. You have the uncle who has his own motives and has made certain decisions. You have the threat that perhaps something from outside will happen to the country. Hamlet is shocked that his mother didn't know that his uncle killed his father. He doesn't sort of believe it. And when he believes it, when he really begins to understand that his uncle killed his father and married his mother he really takes it to his mother and says, 'Why do you not see that this person has done this and why are you married to him? And why do you settle for someone who is this person compared to your husband?' He really finds it shocking that his mother not only marries his uncle but that she doesn't seem to be useful or helpful in setting things right. And then we get to see Hamlet try to fix what has happened. And then we see how things go wrong. And then finally we are given an opportunity to start again at the end of the play. So that's how I see the storytelling, and I think it's beautifully done. I think it tells us things of the present, of the past, of what happens when we die, of what it means to be alive and to fight for the things that you believe in.\n",
            "How the Zimbabwean audience responds to death in Hamlet So there are many different tribes in Zimbabwe and the Shona people are the largest. And their beliefs about death are very, very specific. A bad death is described as something that has happened to the deceased that someone else with evil intent or other intent - well, evil intent - has done to cause that death. And in Hamlet you have a king who has been killed by his brother so that the brother can take o­ver the kingdom. And that is a bad death because no one has a right in Shona culture to take another person's life. And it's particularly a bad death because until that has been set right, until this person has actually been punished for what he has done, the other person cannot rest well. And actually in Hamlet the ghost does say he cannot rest in peace until his death has been revenged. In Shona culture it's just the same. So that the dead person cannot become an ancestor if there's unfinished business which is that the person who's made him die has to be punished. And one of the things I find fascinating about Hamlet is how he's viewed as someone who takes too long to do what he does. Because I think he takes just the right amount of time because about a third of us, a third of Zimbabweans live outside of Zimbabwe because of many different reasons. And so we often find young men coming back home at the death of a parent, at the death of a grandmother, because they study elsewhere, we work elsewhere. We rely on being outside of Zimbabwe to make a living and to contribute to our families. So when you come back it is highly inappropriate to do anything too quickly because you need to know what has been happening when you were not there. Certainly that's my experience, you know, going back to Zimbabwe and having to find out exactly how my father died. And this has happened to me. You know, what happened, hearing the story of what happened. And who was there. And what then happened and how can I as a son start to put things together. So to pay off those people perhaps who looked after him or to do the work around his death. So I think when Hamlet comes back to Denmark and sees the ghost of the father and then he has to really think, I mean he has to be methodical about what happened, what exactly happened. He has to try and understand it before he does anything else. And so the fact that in the Western world his taking of the time is viewed as a problem - in fact I've had many actors say, 'Why doesn't Hamlet just kill his uncle?' - and my thought as a Zimbabwean person, as a person, is to say he has to find out what happened. And in Hamlet of course the way he finds out and how he finds out and when he finds out, and then how he then goes about setting things right is what makes the play so beautiful I think. And I think I have the particular view of it because of my background and where I come from. Performing Hamlet in Zimbabwe and South Africa So we performed Hamlet in Zimbabwe but we also performed it in South Africa. And I think in Zimbabwe they were so enchanted by the fact that we began the show with a funeral procession which was not specific to any character. But because we wanted to talk about death. So we started off with a very, very famous folk song which is sung at funerals. So we put everyone in the zone, in the mood to think about death. And as the character of Hamlet started sort of going through the process of finding out what happened to his father, the audience were slowly beginning to see the reality of what is at stake. So they began to really see how evil, if you like, Claudius is. And so the audience were responding to all of these little Shona culture things that we had inputted into the production. When Hamlet was questioning his mother in the bedroom the audience were just open-mouthed. They agreed, they go, 'Ah ha, mmm,' you know. Those sounds that they make: 'Mm um oh'. Just a sense of shock that you get with the Shona audience: 'Ah,' and, you know, I was playing Gertrude and Hamlet is saying to her, 'And you used this bed, this bed'. And the audience just go 'Oh,' because they suddenly see it. And that's the genius of Hamlet because if you don't see the horror of what's happened you don't understand it.\n",
            "Hi, guys! Welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today, I'm going on a day trip to London with my family so I thought I'd take you along. Let's go! So, we just got the train into London. We got the Tube to King's Cross and now we're here at the British Library. Really excited because we're going to go to an exhibition which is called 'Harry Potter: A History of Magic', I think. I think there's a sign, there. Which should be really fun. I'm a really big Harry Potter fan, so I think it'll be really interesting to find out more about the world and everything. So, I'll give you an update when I'm out. Bye! So, we went to the Harry Potter exhibition. It was so cool! All the it had different sections for all the different subjects at Hogwarts and all the history and mythology and everything behind it. It was so interesting and really, really fun. Now we're just leaving Victoria station. We're going to find somewhere to eat dinner and then we're off to the theatre, so I will see you later! So, it's a couple of weeks later now, but I just wanted to finish off the video. I had an incredible time at the theatre! We went to see Hamilton, which is an American musical that's only just come to London this winter. I've been a huge, huge fan since I first heard the soundtrack, about a year and a half ago now, and I've been wanting to see it for so long. We booked our ticket a whole year ago, so I've been waiting for a whole year, and I was so excited - and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The whole thing was so well done. The acting was amazing. We even had the understudies for both of the lead characters and they were both brilliant. One of the coolest things was that me and my sister decided to go to the stage door after the performance to try and see the cast, which we managed to do. We even got our programmes signed - here's mine, here - and I got signatures from five of the main cast, which was so cool and I'm definitely going to keep this as a treasured souvenir for a long time. All in all, I had a really great day. It's always fun to go to London and it was lovely to spend time with my family as well. Sorry if the camera was a bit shaky at points or if it was a bit loud when I was outside. I was just experimenting with doing a different kind of video. I hope that you liked it and I'll try and do some more fun things in the future, and I'll see you next time.\n",
            "Next on the programme we have an interview with someone who has been writing a book about high-achieving teenagers. Welcome, Louise Hardy. Hi, it's lovely to be here. Louise, many of these teenagers who have achieved success and fame early on, have done so through using new technology, haven't they? Through blogging or using YouTube or Twitter? Absolutely, and the greatest example of this is Justin Bieber. As I think everyone on the planet knows, he started off by posting videos on YouTube at the age of 14 and was spotted by a talent scout who worked with the R&B singer Usher. After that he very rapidly became a worldwide sensation. I heard that last year he was said to be more influential than Obama! Yes, that was because he is number one on Twitter. He has over 35 million followers. There's a new one every two seconds. A company that analyses social media called Klout said that he is the most influential person in the world because of that. But whether he's really more influential than Obama, well Mmmm. All this exposure has negative consequences for young people too, doesn't it? Yes. Although millions adore Justin, a lot of people don't. One of his videos was the most disliked ever. And he has a big problem with privacy. He's followed everywhere by the paparazzi, and that's bad for anyone, never mind a teenager. OK, let's turn to a very different teenager. Tavi Gevinson was even younger when she began, wasn't she? Yes, she was only eleven years old when she started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. By the way, for British listeners, 'Rookie' is an American word used for a person who is new to something. Thanks. On her blog she posted photos of herself wearing unusual combinations of clothes and wrote about them. Some of them were quite weird. Well, yes, I suppose a lot of high fashion is weird. Anyway, she quickly built up a huge following, up to 300,000 readers per day, and many of them were adults. Serious fashion magazines interviewed her and sent her to fashion shows in Europe and to meet top designers, like Karl Lagerfeld. Some people didn't believe she was as young as she was, did they? No, one magazine printed an article saying the writer didn't believe Tavi was only 12, and that upset her. But she bounced back and continued blogging. Then, as she grew older, Tavi became interested in other things besides fashion. In 2011, when she was 15, she started Rookie Magazine, an online magazine for teenagers. In less than a week it had one million readers. I've seen it. It's very impressive, isn't it? All teenage girls listening, check out Rookie Magazine. Yes, I think it's fantastic and Lady Gaga called Tavi 'the future of journalism'! She employs about 50 writers and photographers - both adults and teenagers - on Rookie, but she is the editor with overall control. And all this time she's continued to lead a normal life, hasn't she? Oh yes, she lives a very normal life in a small town and goes to school and so on. She's not even twenty yet. But I think writing and editing are very different from being a performing artist. There's a lot less pressure from fans and the press. Although some actors, like Emma Watson, seem to manage a private life and getting a normal education. Yes, Emma Watson is now in her twenties, of course, but\n",
            "Reporter: It is one of the rules of Africa - if you see a hippo, head the other way - but this is Jessica and she breaks all the rules. Reporter: Tonie Joubert, a game warden, found her washed up by flood water when she was just a day old. Seven years on, she's still here. Tony: I don't know whether she sees me as a hippo or she sees herself as a human. All I know is that, er, there's a fantastic bond that I've never had with any other animal my whole life. I've raised elephants and buffalo and lions and that stuff but I've never had something this close, never ever. Reporter: Jessica spends her days lazing in the sun... and cooling down in the water with Tony and his wife on hand to deliver refreshments, weak sweet coffee, twice a day. Then there's the afternoon snack with the dogs and if Jessica is still hungry, she knows where to go. A short walk to the house, where a closed door doesn't stop her, even if the dog gets in the way. She's already broken a sofa and the bed inside, so everywhere but the kitchen's off limits. But the kitchen is her favourite place. Tony's wife: Jessica sees herself as our child... she sees herself as a human being, one of us, part of the family. That's what she is, that is what she is to us. Reporter: And how do you see her? Tony's wife: I see Jessica as my daughter, hundred per cent. I can't imagine my life without Jess. Reporter: And Jessica seems happy to stick around. It's one thing to tame a hippo in captivity, but what makes Jessica so remarkable is that she's free to leave at any time. Further along this river there's a pod of wild hippos and Jessica likes to spend time with them but she always comes back here, probably because she knows she's onto a good thing. The hippo kills more humans in Africa than any other wild mammal but Jessica has never displayed any aggression. And after a long hard day of eating she likes a massage before she goes to bed. Hippos live into their forties and Jessica is expected to mate and breed so there could soon be another hefty pet here, curling up with the dogs, to go to sleep. Emma Hurd, Sky News, Hoedspruit, South Africa.\n",
            "I want to talk about, erm, horror films and why I like them and what my favourite types are. When I was young, I watched the classic horror films like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. My mum told me that when I was about six, she came downstairs in the middle of the night because there was a noise, and it was me watching The Omen on TV in the dark, on my own. So I guess I've always liked horror films. I really like what are called 'slasher films' - the really gory, bloody, violent films like Final Destination and The Hills Have Eyes. I just find them quite funny and I like the special effects. I don't really find them scary at all. I think the scariest sort of films are the ones that are very tense, like Hitchcock films. I think the scariest one for me is The Birds because it's just very sinister the way that the birds come and sit and look at the people. And you know that it's going to be really bad very soon. But I think my favourite, favourite sort of horror films are zombie movies. I've watched loads of zombie movies and I really like them. Again, I don't really think they're very scary. Dawn of the Dead is my absolute favourite horror film, I think. It's a film where people just wake up one morning and there are zombies everywhere. If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. And the survivors end up in a shopping mall... in a shopping centre and they're surrounded by zombies. And it does not have a happy ending. There's a British comedy horror film called Shaun of the Dead, which is a bit of a joke on the idea of the Dawn of the Dead, which is also really great. The most recent one I watched was a New Zealand film called Black Sheep, which is about zombie sheep. That was pretty funny as well. The most recent horror film I watched was on a plane last time I went back to the UK. It was a Stephen King film, it was based on a Stephen King book - I think a short story - and it was called The Mist. It was about people who lived in a small town in America and there was a hurricane, or typhoon, as we call them here. And after the typhoon, they wanted to go into town to get some supplies to fix up the house. And it started to get misty or foggy. It was quite a strange mist - it didn't look normal. And these people ended up in a hardware store in the town, all trapped together because there were sort of monsters in the mist - these unrealistic giant creatures that were in the mist that were killing people. There was quite a lot of blood and guts and people died in horrible ways, which is what I like about horror films. I would recommend it if you like horror films as much as I do.\n",
            "Hi guys! My name's Sophia and this video is for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to talk to you guys about the differences living in a cold and warm or hot climate. So, I've been living in Sicily now for the last five months, but before that I was living in Scotland. As you can imagine, the climates are very, very different. So I wanted to just share some of the things that I've experienced living in a hot and a cold climate. Of course, number one has to be the weather. Er, living in a hot climate you would think that it would be warm and sunny all year round, right? Wrong! In Sicily it actually has been pretty cold recently. As you can see, I'm wearing a turtleneck and long-sleeved jumpers. I arrived with just two jumpers and a lot of short, sleeveless tops, which was not very smart of me. In December it was actually snowing in Sicily! Yeah, where did the sun go? Living in Scotland, everyone thinks that it's a lot colder than it actually is, when in reality I live on the east coast - or I used to live on the east coast - and it was only ever one or two, maybe three, degrees colder than London, so it isn't as cold as everyone makes it out to be. hair. Now, if you have curly hair like me or wavy hair then you'll know the struggles of keeping your hair nice and defined in humid, hot climates. When it's really hot here my hair just turns into a very big frizzball. When I was living in Scotland my hair was, erm, a lot more defined, as in, like, my curls were like little ringlets, it wasn't all bushy and big. Erm, but here my hair gets dry very quickly because the heat and the humidity sucks out all the moisture. houses. Now this might sound a little bit strange, but just hear me out. Um, in the UK and in colder climates, houses are generally built to have good insulation and to keep in heat. On the other hand, in warm climates, houses are built to keep out heat, and that is logical if it was warm all year round. So, I don't know if you can hear the echoing in my house at the moment, but my floors are made out of marble and very tall ceilings, unlike most houses in the UK. And, on top of that, there's no wall insulation. So, when it was December I was absolutely freezing. It was actually warmer outside than it was inside because the houses here are made to keep out the heat. So, ahh, the winter months are very rough if your hot climate isn't as hot as it should be. food. So, I think as well as culture shaping dishes and, erm, traditional foods, so does the climate. In the UK, a lot of our dishes, erm, use potatoes because we grow a lot of potatoes. A traditional British dish is shepherd's pie, or it may be known as cottage pie, which is with minced meat and, um, kind of like a mash or mashed potato on top, kind of. That wasn't a very good description! But in Italy, erm, a lot of the dishes use, erm, local produce, so a lot of local fruits and vegetable are incorporated into the national dishes. I also think that, in Sicily, food is much more seasonal. In the UK we find fruits and vegetables from all over the world all year round. In Sicily, a lot of the fruit and veg is generally sourced locally or in neighbouring countries like Spain. And, erm, because of that, it's very seasonal. So, it means that only if strawberries are in season you'll see strawberries in the supermarket. And that was something that I kind of took for granted, because in a cold climate we don't grow those fruit and veg normally, so we always import them and we don't really know the difference between seasonal food and non-seasonal food. I hope you enjoyed this video. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to stay tuned for our latest upcoming videos. As ever, please comment below, and let me know if you live in a hot or a cold climate, and, if you do, what is your favourite thing about that hot or that cold climate. Until the next one, have a lovely day and I'll see you soon. Bye!\n",
            "It's essential we keep an eye on our family and friends because it can be easy not to notice when someone has a mental health problem. But we've got some simple signs to look out for. It might be a change in sleeping habits. Is your friend sleeping all the time or not at all? Have you noticed a change in eating habits? They might not be eating enough. Or maybe they've started eating too much. It could even be a change in behaviour. Has your mate stopped hanging out with you like they used to? Do they have sudden outbursts of anger? Sometimes it might just be a change of tone in their message or a post. Any change in normal habits and behaviour over a prolonged period of time can be a sign that something isn't right and the best thing you can do to help is to talk to them. So you may spot that a friend's having difficulties or they may come to you with a problem, but either way, what should you do next? And this is a thing that actually happens to me and Chris all the time. We do bring our problems to each other and confide in each other and it's very hard to know what to say. We've come to meet Caroline. She's been a school counsellor for over 25 years, supporting hundreds of students. Caroline's gonna listen in as I try to help Xand with some issues in his life. Tell me about it. I'm just not getting enough sleep. I'm always tired and irritable. So why don't you go to bed a bit earlier? There are too many things to worry about. It is difficult, but there are a lot of people who are struggling more than you. I know that there are people having a worse time than me, but that doesn't make me feel any better. I like this girl and she just stopped answering my texts. Why don't you show me the texts? I don't want to show you the texts. Well, I can't help you with the texts if you don't show me the texts. It seems to me you're just getting annoyed at me. You were the one that wanted to hear my problems. I don't find what you're doing now very helpful. I can't quite see how anything's gonna, gonna get better. So what I'm feeling now is I don't know what to do. Caroline, what should I be doing? Why do you want to fix him? You're very much wanting to have answers, and some problems don't have answers. So I should just listen to Xand, not jump to give advice. I didn't feel like you were listening. It did feel judgy. I judged you and felt that you should do some things or that you shouldn't do other things. You can't know how he's feeling. I got this wrong. Don't judge, just reassure your friend you're there for them. I think it also really helps to talk to somebody who's not involved. The temptation is to go, 'If I'm a really good friend, I can also be your counsellor', and those two things are not necessarily true together. So don't be afraid to get help from an adult you trust, because someone like a counsellor may be the best person to deal with the situation.\n",
            "Hi, I'm Jessica Parker and you're watching 'Own It'. I'm an online special effects make-up artist and I taught myself these skills by watching a lot of really cool content on sites like YouTube and Instagram. Today I'll be sharing with you a tutorial on how to create a really cool Day of the Dead mask for Halloween. I recommend doing this on something that you don't mind getting paint or glue on, and for this tutorial you will need: a plain mask from a craft store - the one I have here is cardboard - a set of brightly coloured paints and some brushes to use with them, a pack of gems in different colours and shapes, and some 3D paints to outline our skull design. If you need some design ideas, you can google 'Day of the Dead skull' and look through the different styles and patterns that come up. If the mask you have is round like mine, you'll want to start by cutting out the sides, so that the shape is more like a skull. Then you can go in with a pencil, or pen if your mask is plastic, and draw on the design that you want. It can be as simple or as complicated as you like, and once you have your pattern guide drawn on, you can go in and start painting. I use black around the eyes, nose and mouth to mimic the look of a skull and then I use lots of different bright colours to fill in the rest of the pattern. You can use any colour anywhere you like. Once that's all painted and dry, you can go in with a black 3D-effect paint and outline all of the designs. I added some of this in gold and silver as well in a few places, and I also used the black for the swirl patterns that go all over the mask. You'll then need to leave that to dry for a few hours or overnight if you can, and the last step is to add in all these different gems. You can add these wherever you like on the mask and you want to glue them down and leave those to dry. And there you have it! Thanks for watching and remember you can get lots more inspiration for more amazing stuff you can do in the digital world on the Own It website. Happy Halloween!\n",
            "I'd like to welcome Charles Long to the studio today. Charles has just published an article in New Science journal about memorisation. It's all about how to make our memory function better. Charles, exam time is looming and there'll be lots of teenagers tuning in today. Can you give us some advice about improving our ability to memorise? Hello! Yes, of course. I'd like to start by talking about the process of memorisation. It's vital that we understand the process if we want to make adjustments to the way we function. We all use memory in the same way. It doesn't matter whether you're a student revising for your finals or an adult standing in the aisle of a supermarket, trying to recall a particular item from a grocery list. Ha ha! That's me. I always forget to take my list. You and thousands of other people too, Mary. We learn to use our memory when we are still at nursery school. Young children are naturally very good at working out how to remember things. The tips I'm going to share today are based on the things we used to do to help us remember when we were children. The process of memorisation occurs in two distinct forms. Do you know what they are? Are they 'long-term memory' and 'short-term memory'? That's right! But these aren't completely separate concepts. We use a combination of both types of memory when we want to formulate our thoughts and recall information, whether we're trying to remember something from a decade ago or just an hour earlier. So what tips have you got for improving the quality of our memory? Right. Let's start with 'association'. Association? Yes. We can use word association to remember an idea or a concept. This means choosing a word or phrase you associate with what you are trying to remember. The word needs to be something familiar, that you come into contact with on a daily basis. So, for example, you can use the name of your pet dog to remember a scientific equation. Try it! Read the equation a few times and then say your dog's name again and again. Later, in your science exam, just recall the name and the whole equation should come back to you. It sounds too good to be true! What else, Charles? Visualisation is another trick we can use. So you have to visualise an image that is connected to the thing you need to remember. For example, if you want to remember the date that the Berlin Wall came down, you might visualise a picture of a wall with the date written on it in graffiti. The image of the wall becomes an important part of what you will remember. You can use several images in a row to remember things like information in a text or a list of ingredients for a recipe. Yes, that makes sense. Singing can help with memorisation too. Singing? Yeah. So instead of reading a text aloud, you sing it. Singing is one of most effective and earliest memory tricks that are used for learning new concepts. I used to 'sing' lists of historical facts and dates. It works. And did you have to sing aloud in your history exams? Not aloud! But I did used to sing in my head. And I always got good marks for history. Any more tips, Charles? Yes! I've saved the best one till last. It's particularly relevant for any students who have tuned in. 'Teach it'. Teach it? Teach 'what'? Teach whatever it is that you want to remember. So, if you're studying for an English exam, teach the concepts to someone else. It can be a real person - a friend in a study group is ideal - or it can be a 'pretend' person. You can just imagine someone is listening to you as you teach. Better still, record yourself 'teaching' and then play back the video to revise the material further. That sounds like a great tip or 'trick'. Yes, it really works because in order to teach something you need to understand it. Teaching reinforces the understanding. And although these sound like 'tricks', they aren't really. No? No. They are just simple ways that we can train our brains to be more effective. By getting into the habit of using word association, visualisation, singing and teaching, our brains develop and work better for us. And of course that has a knock-on effect on our memory and our abilities to recall all kinds of data. Thank you, Charles. Now, I think we've got time for a couple of questions from our listeners.\n",
            "Good morning. Today I'm going to talk about how to study. Now you probably think you know all about that, right? You've been studying for years. And I expect some of you are fantastic at studying, really organised and good at concentrating. But there's always room for improvement, and your exams aren't far away, so these tips are for all of you. Right, so, what's the best way to study? Well, first of all, it's a good idea to have some kind of plan or timetable. This could be for the week or a longer revision timetable for an exam, from one month to six months. Yes, if you're studying for an important exam it's important to think long term. Draw up a timetable, but revise it often. If it's not going to plan, you may have to rethink it. Next, think about your environment. Make sure the place where you are going to study is comfortable with enough light, air, etc. Not too hot, not too cold. Make sure there are no distracting noises around, such as television. If you think you concentrate better listening to music, experiment and see if it's really true. Some people really do seem to work better with music in the background, especially classical music, but for many people it spoils their concentration. However, if you have to work near a TV, you might have to use headphones to play music to drown out the sound of the TV. In this case, find out what kind of music works best for you, maybe something without words. By the way, you might think you work fine with the TV on, but, again, experiment. You might be surprised at how much better you work away from a TV. Oh, and the other thing is the internet, text messages, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Forget about all of that while you're studying. No, really, you can ignore it for an hour or so; it won't be the end of the world if you don't reply to a message immediately. Right, planning breaks. Plan your study periods in chunks with regular breaks. Many people recommend half an hour of concentrated study, then a ten-minute break. But you can adjust this to suit you. If you study for too long at a stretch your mind will work less effectively, so be careful. In your short break, you can give yourself a treat, such as a cup of green tea. I wouldn't advise a chocolate bar as a treat - a sugar rush is not great for concentration. OK, so next let's think about what you do when you're studying. Some people just read through their notes or textbooks and underline in pencil or highlight important bits. If this works for you, fine, but I'd suggest that it's better to write notes of some kind, so your mind is processing the information more. This way you are also producing material which will be useful for last-minute revision. I don't recommend very last-minute revision, by the way, but we'll come back to that later. Have a look at these examples of student notes. Which do you think are best? The first person has written important phrases at random, the next has a table with clear headings and boxes with notes, the next has summaries, and the last one has mind maps: you've got the main topic in the circle, then lines coming off the circle attached to subcategories, then more lines to further details. Mind maps are great for showing the connections between different bits of information. They seem to work in the same way the brain works. So what do you think? To me, the first one wouldn't be very useful to come back to and use in the future. But the others are all fine - it depends on your personal preference. Mine is for mind maps. I would suggest using colours, though, and even little drawings. They can make things much more memorable. Obviously, when you are studying, the first thing to think about is whether you understand the information, and the second thing is how you are going to remember it. Let's look at some more ways of making information more memorable\n",
            "Hello, Melissa. Hello, Joanna. What would you like to tell us about today? I would like to tell you about the organisation which is called The Hypatia Trust, erm, located in Penzance in Cornwall, that I founded in, er, 1996. It is allied to Exeter University and it is a, an institute which encourages lifelong learning for women. We concentrate on women's lives, both their careers and their family life, and virtually anything which they have accomplished - which often, in history, is, erm, swept over or sort of edited out of normal histories. Do you want to tell me about some of the projects that The Hypatia Trust has been involved in? Yes, yes, I would like to. Er, we have, for example, we have a Wikipedia group which, erm, spend a lot of time and effort in their own homes working on the entries for women on the net, on the internet. This is very helpful because very often men forget that women are there when they're talking about their lives and their achievements! This is one project. We also have art exhibitions of women's art, er, craft. Er, er, that might be sewing, that might be needlework, you know, it might be needlework or it could be painting or any sculpture, that sort of thing. And we also have lectures where women who have climbed Everest or done something else remarkable will come and tell us about the experience. Erm, we have some very fine offices with meeting rooms that the community can also use for their projects. Altogether we are a kind of a community centre, but basically we are a women's learning institute and we promote anything which leads to lifelong learning For women? For women. OK. Though we don't, erm, disinvite men attending, because they need to learn as well. Exactly. OK. Thank you very much for talking to us. You're welcome.\n",
            "It's easy to imagine that the Ice Age affected only remote mountain ranges. But it also left a legacy that has affected millions of people. Manhattan - the island at the centre of New York. When you look at it from a distance, it's actually got a very distinctive profile. There are two clusters of skyscrapers, with much lower buildings in the middle. This is a direct result of the Ice Age. 20,000 years ago, this part of America was at the edge of a vast ice sheet that covered much of the northern hemisphere. The ice would have towered over any modern skyscrapers. When it retreated, just as in Yosemite, ice left behind these boulders, rock smoothed and polished by ice. The ice exposed a hard bedrock called schist, solid enough for sinking deep foundations to support tall buildings. Without this schist, New York couldn't have been built so high. The one part of the skyline that dips is the one place where the ice sheet deposited mud and soil, no good for building towering skyscrapers.\n",
            "OK? OK. Yeah. Go ahead and take a seat. Is she miked up? Are we ready for quiet? OK, so keep in mind this is being cut together. You are free to ad-lib things that are true for you instead of my examples I'm, like, nervous now. We're daughters and mothers. Sisters and soulmates. We are strong and bold. She likes being the boss, she likes being in charge. We're teachers and very good listeners. We are doctors and lawyers. We are data scientists. We are recruiters. Musicians. Engineers. Athletes. We are game changers. Flawless and fearless. We are badass. And we are equals. We're motivators. Instigators. We're leaders. Risk-takers. We're shoppers, for sure. Breadwinners. Bread bakers. We are dreamers. Executives. And we are creators. We support each other. We are girlfriends and wives. We have girlfriends and wives. We go fast. We get our hands dirty. We paint our nails. Or don't paint our nails. I don't paint my nails. How's my hair? We keep it together. We are the glue. We hold it down. We are women.\n",
            "Hello, welcome to Shake it Off Fitness. How can I help you? Yes, thanks. I've been meaning to come in and find some information about here for some time. I was wondering if you could help me? Sure, of course. What would you like to know? I saw on the sign outside that you have the best budget membership in the city. Is that right? You've got that right, yes. If you find a better rate, then we'll match it. Also, we don't have any sign-up fees or cancellation fees. Sorry, what was that last bit? Cancellation fees. Some gyms charge you money if you leave before a minimum number of months or something like that. We don't do that. That's useful to know. Ummm, what times do you have? We open at 5 a.m. and close at midnight. Not 24 hours then, I see. No. Almost, though! We tried doing the 24-hour thing, but there really weren't a lot of people who wanted to do exercise at 2 in the morning. Makes sense. Another question: do you have trainers? Like, will you do a personalised evaluation of me? Sure we do. As we say on our brochure, we can show you what to do, how to do it and why you're doing it. Have you worked with a personal trainer before? Err, no. No, I haven't. No. So, it's very easy. For your first visits we'll assign you one of our expert personal trainers. He or she will design an exercise plan that's just right for you and show you exactly what to do. We even include nutrition advice in the plan. Let me get this straight. All of this is included in the price? Yes, it is. If you want to continue with your trainer after the first few classes, we can talk about that. It does cost extra though. OK? Yeah. Sounds... great. Do you have any other questions? Hmmm, yeah. Um, OK. Why should I choose here instead of any of the other gyms in the city? What, you mean apart from our competitive rates and personalised attention? Yeah, I guess. Listen, here's a free day pass. Why don't you drop by and see for yourself? That way you can talk to other members, see the facilities and our staff. OK, I'll do that. Thanks very much!\n",
            "I'm not sure when it originally began. I just have this feeling of always wanting to perform. When I was young I would put on little shows for my family, you know, in my home. And I just loved the idea of telling stories and that was the joy of it. And Shakespeare wasn't someone that I necessarily knew about that much. I'd heard his name before but I didn't know what his plays were about particularly. And then as I got to school I then was introduced to Shakespeare. The first time I got to play and be in Romeo and Juliet, I played Juliet at the Bolton Octagon which is a theatre in the north of England. It was in the round, the audience were all around us and it was set in Italy. And we were rich youth of Italy and that was kind of the scene. And I enjoyed it so much, I loved playing Juliet, but unfortunately it was a really short run. We did about three weeks. And so a couple of years later I got the opportunity to play Juliet again. I jumped at the chance. I wasn't ready to finish with her. I wanted to kind of have that again, and also the chance to play in London and to play Juliet on The Globe stage, which is where this play was originally written for. You know, there was already the balcony built in to the theatre for that scene. We were performing it mainly for teenagers. And so the teenagers are there seeing teenagers on stage which I found fantastic. We were up there representing them in a way. And we were dressed like them. There were scenes where I was in school uniform and a lot of the audience were in school uniform as well. And it just meant that they could really follow. I think Romeo and Juliet is so good for young people because they can really follow the story. These are situations that they can find themselves in as well. Especially the idea of falling in love for the first time or seeing people that you fancy. Or the situations with your parents. And what I love about performing Romeo and Juliet is, especially to young people, or to people who maybe have never been to the theatre before, is that when you ask a question as your character we often got an actual response from the audience. And they really invest in Romeo and Juliet, I think. And even though you may know what's going to happen - most people who watch it do know the fate of Romeo and Juliet - they still kind of go on the ride with them. They still have the joy of them falling in love. And they feel that and they go through that. And then it's so heartbreaking at the end. When I started actually speaking Shakespeare's words out loud I did find a love for it. I love how Shakespeare made up words sometimes. When he couldn't find the right word to make sense of what he was trying to say. And also of course sometimes he writes in rhyme and so he needed to make up a word that would fit the rhyme. And I really liked that about it. I like the poetry of it. And also the fact that his stories were quite vivid and exciting. And what people go through, especially like in Romeo and Juliet. These are two young people, 14, around that age. And they have such an amazing, tragic, but such an exciting kind of few days. And what a kind of joy to read that as a teenager yourself.\n",
            "I think there's so much in it. I mean the first thing that you think of is young love. The idea of falling in love for the first time. The excitement of that, the danger of that in many ways. That idea of when you're a teenager those first kind of arguments you start having with your parents. The first times you start realising you think something different to your mum and dad. And also the idea of young people like the guys, and they're getting into fights all the time. And there's kind of unnecessary bloodshed, and unnecessary arguments I think is something that happens as a teenager. Maybe it doesn't lead to death, but it's these unnecessary arguments and people growing up and not knowing how to necessarily deal with their emotions, and it all spiralling out of control. There's also the idea of these two families that are at war, that are fighting against each other. And this is an argument that has gone back so many years nobody even knows why, and yet still it's the young people, it's the next generation who suffer. I loved Juliet actually. And what I found interesting playing her is that before you hear a lot about Juliet and actually when I read the play I realised how feisty she is. How determined she is. And how funny she is. I found her really funny. And I found that really exciting to kind of find different parts of her, different elements of her. She's a good girl at heart. She wants to obey her parents. She wants to be good but she has this... when she meets Romeo and she falls in love she has this desire that's kind of stronger than her parents. And I think a lot of teenagers get to that point when suddenly they go, 'There are things that my parents are saying that I don't necessarily agree with. Or that I want to challenge, or I want to ' you know, you want them to understand your side of the story. And I love, in the balcony scene where Juliet is saying, 'Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy fortune,' you know. It's really quite she knows exactly what she wants. And it's not 'Oh, where are you Romeo? Ah, you're so lovely.' It's 'Come on, Romeo, come and find me. Forget about the fact that our families are against each other, fight all the time. If you want me, come and find me.' She knows what she wants and I love that. She's very determined. So we performed in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Again most of those performances were for teenagers out there as well, which was incredible. It's always great to tour and to perform to different communities and in different countries. It's fantastic. We had to change some of the production a little bit, just out of respect. When we were in the Middle East we didn't kiss on the lips, Romeo and Juliet, we kissed on the hands. And we just adapted it a little bit just so the teenagers, again so it could be more relatable to them and less alien. There was a bit of a difference I suppose with the audiences in the Middle East compared to London. They were a lot quieter in the Middle East. You could see them and they were with us, they were responding. But at the end, the uproar and the applause was incredible. And the smiles were incredible. And then when we performed in London the young people particularly were very loud and engaged vocally throughout, shouting. Really going with the production, shouting along with the show. There's this line that always sticks out. 'My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep. The more I give to thee the more I have, for both are infinite.' And I just love that line. I remember having such joy saying it. It's one of those moments when she says that in the play where she is at her most happiest and her most joyful. Both of them. It's that kind of moment where at that point everything is going well. And I think that kind of sums it up.\n",
            "Hi, this is Beattie on the Get Into Film channel and I'm very excited today because I had my first assignment. I was hanging out with Aaron Sorkin and I had an absolute blast with Kate Winslet. I think she really liked me. They're in town to talk about their new film, Steve Jobs, which, funnily enough, is about Steve Jobs, who you'll know as he made all of the i products like the iPad, the iPhone, the iMac and I really liked it. The film was really captivating and there was just so much to get your head around. I honestly cannot imagine being an actor and getting that script for the first time. Well, it was a very different experience for all of us working on a film like this one where there are so many words because as an actor, you know, you learn your lines and that's just a given, it's a basic thing, everyone has to do it, you know, you try not to make mistakes on the day but with dialogue like this because there is so much of it, the concentration that we all had to have, just in that process of really getting the dialogue down was huge. It's 187 pages and Michael Fassbender is on every single page, and so for him, it was like Hamlet times two, it was so hard! You talk about 187 pages. I've got three cards here and I'm a bit worried! I've been in a few productions myself. I can't imagine learning the lines for this one. How did you do that? We were lucky because we had a lot of rehearsals, so we were able to repeat it, repeat it over and over again for kind of nine, ten days straight before we actually went on set and had to start filming it so by the time we got onto set, in theatre terms we were on performance 100 as opposed to like, you know, the opening night where we would all have been kind of like, terrified and you know, making mistakes every three minutes. Rehearsals sound like they were quite a process, but I was wondering, you know, what was it like when they finally got onto set? We really didn't make that many mistakes. We just we all knew it so well. Because if you make a mistake, you're throwing everybody else as well. That must have been such a relief. I can't imagine messing up one of those really long takes and having to start from the beginning again. I really admired that Kate played a really strong female character in the movie, and I was wondering if that was something that drew her to the role.Kate: It is something that drew me to the role because I think that I like it on film when you see a woman and man, and the man needs the woman more than she needs him. That's cool. It's always good to be needed but I wondered what Steve Jobs got out of his relationship with Joanna Hoffman. The things that Steve would ask her to do on his behalf she was like 'urgh'. She just got kind of, you know, like sick of his crazy little ways. He would even have her sometimes write poems for a girlfriend that he might have, I mean he was pretty outrageous. Steve was really strongly influenced by art in the film, almost as much as technology, but I was wondering, how much has the art of film-making been influenced by technology? It's made a huge difference and I want you to know that you're the first journalist who has asked that question and who has identified the fact that art has a huge influence in Steve's life, so well done. Honestly, and I've done... I'm not just talking about today. I've done like two weeks' worth of interviews Kate Winslet just complimented me! THAT Kate Winslet from Titanic, that one! I think it's played a huge part, I mean things are very different now. The first film I made when I was seventeen years old, which is twenty-three years ago, erm there's a lot of digital effects in that film and they're terrible, you know, I look at them now, I'm like 'oh my god', it all looks so clunky and weird even Titanic, some of those effects then that were pioneering at the time, you know, they look a bit clunky now, you know. Erm... and so yes, I mean yes, we really do live in the most heightened digital age I think ever, and technology has played, my goodness me, a huge, huge part, erm, in how films are made. This acting's a funny old game. Steve seems pretty uncompromising in his life and career, and I was wondering if, as an actor, there's anything that you never want to compromise on. How I instinctively want to play a part, you know, erm, because at the end of the day, sometimes, when the chips are down, all you have is your instincts and even if you're the one who's made the wrong choice, later on, at least in the moment, I would know that I had the strength of my own convictions to say, mm, no, I want to play it that way, and for me, I just never want to look back and wish I'd done it a different way. So, that's one thing I try not to compromise on. Well, there you go. How did she think I did on my first interview? Kate? That was brilliant. You've done it! I'm so proud of myself! It was actually such a good film. I really enjoyed it, and I hope you guys go and see it. If you do, let me know in the comments. It was really great getting pictures with the guys from the film. Don't forget that you can head over to Instagram and Twitter and check out my cheesy smile! Subscribe to Into Film for more behind the scenes interviews and I'll see you next time.\n",
            "I was born in East Africa and I came over here when I was eleven. And so a lot of my upbringing has been here. I wasn't great at English which is a huge regret for me actually. But in a way it sort of doesn't matter because, you know, in my fifties I got to play Lady Macbeth. And it opened a world to me that I hadn't even known was there. The thing is, Shakespeare is a genius for a reason. I had never realised his brilliance. I had always thought it was for other people, clever people, intellectual people. But actually, when I started sort of deconstructing it in a way, you realise it's for everybody. It's for a white person, a black person, anybody. It's universal. The themes, you know, love, greed, ambition, power, all those things are just normal daily things in humans' lives. You know, in all our lives. Across cultures. Across time and space Shakespeare just... And I think that's why he's so relevant, is because his writings of like over 400 years ago resonate so deeply today. Myself, when I was reading Macbeth, you know, we all know certain of Macbeth's lines. I know there are like so many of them in the English language. But for me what was so thrilling was when I started reading Macbeth I was like, 'Oh, “Be all and end all”, that's from here!' you know? And so when I now go and see a Shakespeare, I don't know how other people feel, but I know I get a real thrill when those words that I use today connect me back to his time. It's like, wow. That's thrilling. You know, 'The world is my oyster' or I mean, I can't think, there are so many that we use every day. He's just so clever. For Lady Macbeth it's quite clear what Macbeth needs to do. For the witches' predictions to come true he needs to basically get rid of King Duncan, otherwise how else is he going to become king? And so for her it's really important that Macbeth, you know, actively does something. But she realises that he's too weak. She is the strong one in this relationship, certainly at the beginning of the play. She's the one who's, you know, powering the change in him. She's manipulating him. She wants him to become the king so she persuades him to do these things. And she uses her sexuality. She also, you know, she questions his manhood. So she kind of propels him with this manipulation and putting him down slightly, that he's not man enough. So he can then go on and get what she wants for herself as well. Which is, she wants to be top dog too.\n",
            "Mmm, ambition. Don't we all have it? I sort of wish I was a bit more like Lady Macbeth and the Macbeths actually. Well, the play is about ambition and about what happens when ambition goes, not too far, but sort of unchecked in yourself. We are all ambitious. We all want to get ahead. We all want that, you know, the crown, but we know that we're not going to do certain things, you know? Because we feel we're good people and you can't do that, it's wrong, whatever. But in this play they see an opportunity. And it's interesting that actually Macbeth for me, at the beginning of the play, he's a good guy to me. He's like, 'Yeah, I really want that but of course I'm not going to kill him to get it.' And then his wife, she's like, 'He's not going to do it, is he?' And then what happens in the end? She realises, you know, 'Naught's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content.' And you think, yes, you realise that now. It's like all of us in a way. You know, when you absolutely really want that house and your stomach's churning or whatever it is that you desire so badly, a car or any material thing. In the end you get it and then it loses its lustre. So many Indian films and stories have taken their inspiration from Shakespeare that obviously they relate to it and it's relevant for them. And so for us taking our Asian version of Macbeth through Britain was quite extraordinary. The British Asian audience loved it as did a lot of white audiences actually. What a lot of white people really liked was that they saw a different take on a lot of the Shakespeares they had seen. I mean, for example, our witches were hijras. Now, hijras in India are actually transvestites, transgender. They're actually seen as the third gender. For me that was very exciting using the hijras as the witches in Macbeth. And the audience loved it. And it was interesting because there were people who said, you know, they've seen lots of Macbeths but they've never seen that kind of interpretation of the witches. And there was this lovely woman at one of the venues and she'd come with her children and she said, 'It's really interesting because this is their first Macbeth. I've seen lots. And my first Macbeth was typical witches with the pointy hats. And their version which they will take with them through their lifetime will be these, you know, half-men, half-women in these beautiful, colourful clothes.' I think also we found quite a lot of comedy in the witches as well. Which I think is great because you don't want the witches to just be these one-dimensional, you know, spooky kind of thing. You kind of want them to be a bit more. And what I loved about our Macbeth was actually there was quite a lot of comedy for such a dark piece. Somehow the hijras managed to bring something special.\n",
            "I want to talk about learning languages. I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, Middle East and now here in Hong Kong. And during all of that time, I've learned five or six different languages to one degree or another. I love learning languages. Not only are they important when you move to a country, I just find them fascinating. Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain, for ten years. And when I first arrived, the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally. I don't attend classes. I don't think I'm particularly good in classes. I prefer to learn by just talking to people, finding out what I need to say, by looking at dictionaries and listening carefully. Other things that helped me when I first moved to Spain were watching the typical kinds of programmes we see every day on channels around the world, for example the weather. This is great, because they always say the same things, so you can really quickly hear the same words repeated again and again. And the pictures help of course. Other types of programme that helped me learn Spanish quickly were things like game shows, where the same thing happens. They have a catchphrase or a slogan that they repeat endlessly when contestants win or when they are called to compete. As well as that, I used to pick up the Spanish newspapers. First of all, I just accepted there was no way I was going to understand anything but one or two words. But gradually, I found that I learned lots of new things about this. I was interested because I wanted to know what was happening in the country I lived in. But I also knew that I could learn a lot of language this way. So I'd take a dictionary with me sometimes, or I'd notice a word and I'd ask other people what it meant. Anyway, by far the best practice I ever had was just talking to people in the street or in shops, where I'd rehearse in my head what I wanted to say beforehand, before I went in. Usually, I made a right mess of it first of all, but after you get over the embarrassment, it's quite funny really. And people are very sympathetic and supporting in most cases. It took me a long time to develop a good level of Spanish. I lived there for ten years, and I think I'm very fluent now. But I think for the first two years that I was there it was quite a struggle to hold a decent conversation. There were always lots of words and expressions that I didn't pick up on. In particular with the colloquial expressions, idioms, that kind of thing, that people use in everyday talk, but you don't necessarily see written down. I didn't find those very easy to learn at all. But it was a lot of fun. And people, as I said, are really supporting when they know that you are genuinely interested in learning their language.\n",
            "Welcome back to the second part of our programme, How do you manage? I have with me Jenny Buxton, who works in Ipswich. Welcome, Jenny. Hi. You work for a well-known firm of retailers, but it's not the products I wanted to talk to you about today, it's the people involved. You've been responsible for a staff of 15 for a year or so now. Tell me how you got there. Well, I did the standard round of applications from university and this is my second employer. I enjoy the area of retailing, but as far as managing staff, that's more recent and so it's quite a new area for me, with a whole new set of challenges. You pride yourself on being good with people. You've got quite a sociable, outgoing personality. I imagine you'd be a good person to work under. Well, that's what I like to think. But managing people isn't all about sitting down with a cup of tea and talking over issues. Being in a position of responsibility means you can be the bringer of bad news as well as good. You have to develop a thick skin... to be unpopular, not to be liked for a decision you make. And I guess that can be hard at first. Yes, but the thing you learn, if you stick at it long enough, is that people will still respect you even if they don't like what you had to say on a particular subject or the way you acted. Are there other aspects of line managing that you find difficult? One of the hardest, most awkward things is the issue of disciplinary action. The company should have a system in place for dealing with this kind of area, and you have to make sure the system is understood and agreed by everyone. But ultimately, if you've taken the employee through all the procedures and he or she still doesn't shape up, some hard decisions have got to be made. We seem to be focusing a lot on the negative side here. What about some of the positive things? Oh, the chance to help people reflect on things, how they are developing with the company. I like seeing people develop, change and perhaps go off on a completely new path, something that may never have occurred to them if you hadn't pointed them in that direction. I imagine it can be quite satisfying. Yes. And then there's the sheer variety. You plan your work, you have to get yourself well organised, but ultimately no two days are ever the same. There's always a new challenge, and I like that more than anything.\n",
            "Hi, Luke. Thanks for talking to me today. Hi, Jo. Nice to meet you. Erm, what would you like to talk about? I'm going to talk about living in London, erm, and the kind of love-hate relationship I have with it - and I assume most people do. I've been living in London for about 15 years, maybe a bit longer. And I've lived kind of mostly in kind of north and east London. So I moved to Camden originally and now I live in Hackney, which is probably the kind of trendiest area of London, and that's not necessarily why I live there, but it's a nice area of London. And most people that come to London, visit London, think that central London is London. And, but, where - generally people don't live in central London. Erm, people don't spend too much time in central London. They might work there, but they don't visit there. So, you might come to London as a tourist and go to somewhere like Leicester Square, er, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, Regent Street, that kind of area. And I'm very rarely in that area. Erm, so, I live, erm, slightly on the outskirts but it's not really on the outskirts 'cause it's kind of Zone 2, Zone 3, which for most people that live in London, that's quite close to the centre. So, it takes me about half an hour to get into town. And when you live in London you say 'town' as in 'central London'. And things I love about London is that I've got two children that live in London. Well, my oldest is nine and there's so many things to do, constantly, and so many events every weekend. Erm, you go somewhere like the South Bank and there's always something happening throughout the year. You can always go to the theatre, go to the cinema, there's amazing restaurants and cafés. Erm, there's lots of things to experience but there's also the downside is it's, there's a kind of lack of stillness and quietness that you might get if you live outside the city. But of course you can always go to Royal Parks which are amazing. Erm, I think my favourite thing about living in London is, erm, the kind of, well, where I live particularly there's a bit of a local community, it's kind of like a small village. It's called Stoke Newington, which everyone that lives in London has heard of but tourists haven't necessarily heard of and it's actually quite a nice place to visit. What's the worst thing about living in London for you? Erm, the Underground's pretty horrific, erm, and what I find is, I used to come up to London when my dad worked in London when I was a kid, sort of 20, 30 years ago. Maybe even longer. And there was, there was rush hour, and rush hour was the morning and the evening or the early afternoon, and now London is just one constant rush hour. Doesn't matter what time you get on the Tube or what time you get a bus, it's packed. It's always packed, and if you drive in London as well it's the same thing. It just takes forever to get anywhere. Erm, so, I, my worst thing is how busy it is. It's hectic. OK. Thanks so much for talking to me. Pleasure!\n",
            "I want to talk about my experience of moving out and living on my own. Moving out to live on your own is not very common in Hong Kong. Many people still choose to live with their parents even though they have a decent job and they're already at their 30s. Many of them would stay with their parents until they get married. There are several reasons behind - firstly, Hong Kong's rent is expensive. Many people would rather save up more money to purchase an apartment instead of renting one. Secondly, the Chinese traditional value of family is that the parents are the ones who brought you up. When you become an adult, you should also take good care of your parents and you should spend more time to be with them. And of course there are people who are still dependent on their parents for food, clothing, household chores, etc. When I tell people about the idea of moving out, many people's reaction is like, 'What do your parents say?', because they assume the parents would not like their children to leave them. Well, I don't know if my parents like it, but I can tell you my parents support and respect my decision. They think it is good for me to try and live on my own and then I would know it is the best to stay with my family. The most important reason for independent living is to save the travelling time to work. It used to take me one hour 15 minutes to travel to work from my previous living place. From my new apartment, it just takes me 30 minutes, so I saved 45 minutes' travelling time. I don't have to get up so early and I save two-third of my travelling cost. It does not only save my time to travel for work, but also from most of the places in Hong Kong. In addition, I gain my personal space and freedom by independent living. I make my own decision all the time, I do not have to say whether I would go home for dinner, I can invite my friends to come up and stay late. Of course, there are some trade-offs in living on your own. If you want to rent an apartment, there are lots of preparatory works to do. You have to keep visiting the apartments to search for your ideal one. You have to negotiate with the landlord about the price, furniture inclusion, who is responsible for the maintenance of the furniture and equipments. My experience was that after we moved into the apartment, it was not until the kitchen cupboard was soaked with water that we found out there was water leakage in the kitchen sink. Money is the main issue in living on your own. You have to be responsible for all the expenses, for example the rent, electricity, gas, water, telephone, internet bills, etc. Therefore, you've got to be well prepared and save up for your bills. Although I find my transportation time much shorter, the saved time is spent on other things, such as cooking and some other household chores. I think preparing and cooking the food do occupy a significant portion of my time; therefore, I always try to make simple meals. On the other hand, I have to regularly tidy up my apartment and wash my clothes, so it doesn't really save much of my time after all. Now everything is settled down, I'm getting used to my new life and I am enjoying it. I feel that moving out makes it easier for me to strike a balance between my work, my social life, my study and my family. It may be troublesome, but it may worth.\n",
            "Sometime in the late 1580s a young actor named William Shakespeare left his family and home in rural Stratford-upon-Avon to make his fortune here, 100 miles away in London. Over the next 20 years he produced some of the finest poems and plays in the English language. So what happened here in London to transform the son of a glove maker into one of the world's greatest writers? Today London is a global centre for finance, the arts and fashion, and is one of the most diverse cities in the world. But what was London like when William Shakespeare first arrived here? It was obviously a much smaller city. Much of the activity was focused on the City of London, which is now the financial district. The rest of London was not very much developed. The West End didn't exist, Covent Garden was still a garden, and like modern London it was a very busy, bustling place. There were lots of people coming into the city looking to make a living. It was a very diverse population, lots of immigrants, different social classes living closely together, the very rich to the very poor, and all of these people were hungry for entertainment and particularly the entertainment that the theatre could offer. The buildings that Shakespeare would have known were destroyed in 1666 in the Great Fire of London, so sadly we can't see the city as Shakespeare saw it. Do you think London was a source of inspiration for Shakespeare? Definitely. I am absolutely sure it inspired Shakespeare. Although he tended to write about faraway places, Athens or Rome, the plays are full of the energy of London, a city that's a real melting pot of ideas, the centre of political power, and that world I think is the world of Shakespeare's plays. In his first decade in London, Shakespeare built up a reputation as one of the country's most successful playwrights. But at the end of 1598 Shakespeare's troop of actors, the Chamberlain's Men, had a disagreement with the landowner of their theatre in north London. So in the middle of the night they took the theatre apart, brought the wood, piece by piece, down to the banks of the River Thames, floated every single piece of wood across the water and brought it here to Southwark, an area of London where the land was cheaper, and rebuilt the theatre and called it The Globe. But today, much of Shakespeare's London has disappeared. Only the foundations of the original Globe Theatre remain. We're opposite a square which looks quite plain, office blocks and apartment blocks around us, but this is the site of the original Globe Theatre which opened in 1599. This is where this magnificent theatre once stood. With the arrival of the Globe Theatre, how did Shakespeare and his actors' lives change? Shakespeare for the first time had some real financial stability behind him. He had a large share in the Globe, so he was earning quite a bit of money by this time, and I think from this foundation of financial security his creativity flourished. During the first six or seven years of the opening of the Globe he produces some of his most memorable plays, including the great tragedies, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth. What was their working daily life like here? Shakespeare would have been working very hard indeed. Because plays changed very, very often, this meant Shakespeare would have written plays very quickly and under very demanding conditions. Shakespeare continued his playwriting almost until he died in 1616. But his work lived on thanks to his friends who saved many of his plays in a book now known as the First Folio.\n",
            "In Shakespeare's time this area of London was not only home to actors and theatre-goers. Southwark was a rough, dangerous and fairly lawless part of the city. It's now home to a more modern and rich London. But something of Shakespeare has been kept alive. Just down the road from the original foundations there is a recreation of Shakespeare's Globe, built in the mid 1990s. How similar is it to the one that was here 400 years ago? Well, in terms of the architectural features they were very similar, like the shape of the theatre, the fact that the stage thrusts out into the yard, the fact that there is a stage roof which they used to call the heavens. It has an upper stage balcony, musicians' gallery, the three doors where actors come in and exit, the trapdoor in the stage as well as the trapdoor in the roof, all of those things were features that were in Shakespeare's original theatre in 1599. The materials of the building would have inspired his work. Sometimes there's references in his plays to thatch and to the wooden dialogue of the actors' shoes on the stage. Those types of technologies, those special effects in the theatres, would have inspired scenes where gods are being lowered from the heavens. Those types of things were written into Shakespeare's plays. What were the audience in Shakespeare's time like that came to see his plays here? The audiences were wide-ranging. They came from all social classes. Because it only cost a penny to come into the yard and stand you would have had the working classes, you know, the butchers and the tailors, but also the higher up you go in the galleries the higher the class, and if you pay six pence, which is the most amount you could pay, you would sit in these beautifully painted gentlemen's rooms very comfortably. We have a wide range of audiences from all over the world now, because Shakespeare has such an extraordinary global appeal. It's the magic of his storytelling. Shakespeare wrote 38 plays and over 150 poems, which are still enjoyed today. And whilst we can get an understanding of what Shakespeare's life must have been like in London and how much the city inspired him, I believe his works only truly come alive when they are held in the heart, spoken out loud, wherever you are in the world.\n",
            "I'm feeling honoured that I'm being chosen as the Nobel Laureate and I have been honoured with this precious award, which is the Nobel Peace Prize. And I'm proud that I am the first Pakistani, and the first woman or the first young person, who is getting this award. It is a great honour for me. And I'm also really happy that I'm sharing this award with a person, with a person from India whose name is Kailash Satyarthi, and his great work for child's rights. His great work against child slavery totally inspires me. And I'm really happy that there are so many people who are working for children's rights, and I'm not alone, and he totally deserves this award. So I'm feeling honoured that I am sharing this award with him. This award is not just a piece of metal or a medal that you would wear, or an award that you would keep in your room, but this is really just an encouragement for me to go forward and to believe in myself to know that there are people who are supporting me in this campaign, and we are standing together. We all want to make sure that every child gets quality education, so this is really, this is really something great for me.\n",
            "OK, Craig and Gavin, I realise that there have been some problems between you recently, and I'd like to try and sort them out right now. Gavin, can you tell me why you think this problem has arisen now? You're asking me!? I really have no idea. I mean, I came into this job a year ago with a special project to do. I had a very positive attitude. I was excited about it and Craig's just blocked me all along Well, that's not fair at all! That's just not true! OK, OK, one second. Can everyone speak one at a time, please? Gavin, go on Well, that's about it really. I've never felt as if I've been welcomed here. I mean, when I walk into the office, the others don't even say hello to me That's just not true! It's you who doesn't say hello! Craig, please! Gavin, can you tell me why you think this situation may have arisen? Well, as I said, I've really no idea. Perhaps it's just my style - I'm very positive, energetic and outgoing, while everyone else here seems to be half-asleep. Erm, listen, I don't think that personal, judgemental comments like that help. Can we just stick to facts rather than opinions? OK. Well, I could see right away that some changes needed making here, so I set about making those changes. And was that part of your job description? Job description! Job description! That's all I ever hear round here. That's the problem with this place there's no initiative, no energy. Hmm, OK. Craig, would you like to tell us what you feel the problem is? Well, I think it's quite clear, isn't it? Him! That's it! OK, as I said, can we keep away from personal comments here and stick to talking about the workplace. Well, I am talking about the workplace! He doesn't respect the limits of what he's supposed to do. He came in here for a one-year project, but has then tried to change the way everyone else works as well. Gavin? Can you respond to that? Well, my project involved everyone else! It was impossible to do what I had to do without getting other people to rethink the way they work. OK, I think that personality issues are crucial here. Personality issues are the most difficult things to change. Perhaps we'll never be able to resolve them. You are different people with different personalities and different ways of working. And so? Well, that doesn't mean the problem can't be solved. We have to be flexible, accept change and be tolerant of difference. Easy to say! Well, yes, it is easy to say, but difficult to do! I don't deny that. However, what we need to do is review your project and look at everyone's roles and responsibilities in the project and in this organisation as a whole. If everyone sticks to and respects other people's roles and responsibilities, then we can at least settle on a good, constructive working atmosphere.\n",
            "I come from a very international background. My mother is Japanese and my father is English, but I grew up in Munich in Germany. So I feel very international and not belonging to one place. I first came across Shakespeare at school and only by playing Shakespeare did I start loving Shakespeare. The stories are based all over the world. The majority of them are in England but he writes about Troy, about Egypt, about Greece, Denmark, so having worked in theatre in different countries and seeing how audiences react to Shakespeare, everyone gets it. And I think it's very universal. So my outlook is that it's for everybody. It's for any culture and any person. Much Ado About Nothing is probably one of the most popular Shakespeare plays. And the reason is probably because of the love stories and the relationships. I love the central plot of Beatrice and Benedick and their love. Their hate and their love and their wit. Their war of wit is so fun to watch. And the nastier they can be to each other the better. You want them to be horrible to each other because it's so great. And then when they do get together at the end it pays off. So it's about love. It's about marriage, relationships, communities, expectations from elders. And also deception, people playing tricks on each other and trying to be horrible to each other but also trying to help each other by playing tricks. And so you've got Hero and Claudio trying to trick Benedick and Beatrice so that they fall in love, although that's a beautiful trick to do. There's so much there so it's a great story. In Much Ado About Nothing I played the character of Hero. And she's one of the central characters. But she's a much more traditional woman from Shakespeare's day or how people in that time would have expected women to be. So she's quiet, she's obedient, she's kind, she wants to fall in love. She falls in love at first sight with Claudio and they get married very quickly. But also she's very vulnerable and she becomes a victim. So she's basically become part of the trick and she's very vulnerable in that way. So she's a very fun and complex character but probably a simpler character to play than Beatrice who's much more modern. A modern-day woman, I suppose. She's complicated, she's witty, she's nasty. She doesn't want to do what she's told. She doesn't want to listen to what men say just because they're men and she's a woman. So that dynamic the difference of the two women is a great part of the story. So that was very fun to play. Also the comedy is fun so it's great when the audience laugh at you when Hero and the maid are trying to trick Beatrice by pretending that Benedick is in love with her. And they know she's listening but they're pretending that she's not. Like that seems really fun. You can tell the audience are gripped. So it's a really fun play to do.\n",
            "Japanese audiences probably approach Much Ado About Nothing thinking that it's a foreign play set in Italy. These foreign lovers, what are they doing, it's so different to us. But fundamentally the relationships between the man and woman of both couples - so Beatrice/Benedick, Claudio/Hero, the two couples - they could happen anywhere. So I think that's how Japanese people fall in love with the story as well. The way it's written in English there's a pentameter, there's a rhythm and a lot of imagery in it. The imagery completely translates into Japanese, but the rhythm doesn't quite translate because of the nature of the language. So for me when Japanese people do Shakespeare it becomes much more visual and a joy to watch. A spectacle. Whereas in England it's much more about the words, the words, deliver the words and the beauty in the language. Whereas in Japan it's much more, it's more like a painting when you watch a Shakespeare play. And I think the more successful versions are when a Japanese company do it their way and not try and do it in a Western way. So I recently saw a Kabuki version of Twelfth Night and it was amazing. It was incredibly original, beautiful. Nobody else could do it and the story completely made sense as well. It was all men dressed up, painted, playing female and male, all the roles. And beautiful to watch. I think Japanese women are traditionally more like a Hero character. So even today I think women are... men and women are equal in Japan but there's much more of a sense that you should be married and have children by a certain age. And you should leave work and be the housewife and do what you're told. Traditionally that sense is there and it's probably stronger than what women are expected to be over here in England, in the West. So I think maybe women in Japan are more inclined to be like Hero than Beatrice. And I think Beatrice is probably a much more Western woman from a Japanese perspective. But things are changing. Japan has modernised ridiculously. It's expensive to live in Japan so women have to work, which means they're stronger, they're independent and they become more like Beatrice. So I think Japanese women can relate to both.\n",
            "Hi, Ella! Hello! Thanks for talking to me today. What do you want to talk about? Well, I love music. So I'd like to talk about music. Fantastic. As you might be able to tell, my accent isn't from the UK. I was born in Canada but I live in Manchester now and I'm so happy that I do because I love the music scene there. It's really interesting: the history that's come from the acid house movement through bands like the Happy Mondays, the Dillons, through the culture of clubbing that came from the Hacienda has now left this really cool community of artists of all different genres who still gig and perform there in Manchester. It's really cool hanging out in the Northern Quarter. It's an area that used to be mills back in the industrial era of Manchester but now it's turned into coffee shops and clubs and restaurants. Cool! And do you make music yourself? Yes. I play guitar and piano and I sing. And getting to play with the other musicians there has introduced me to playing a lot more electronic instruments as well, like drum sequencers, playing with Ableton and playing with DJs. What's really interesting about Manchester is the musicians in Manchester focus a lot more on what they love to make than, in my opinion, musicians in London. Musicians in Manchester really like to focus in on the time they spend in the studio and the time they spend creating, forming smaller and smaller communities to hone into a weird or specific sound, whereas in London people are a lot more out and about, and they like performing and socialising and being around each other. Mmm. Do you think you'll stay living in Manchester for a long time or are you planning to go back to Canada? I really like Manchester. I think I'll stay there because the smaller population has meant that the community is a lot more connected and we see each other by circumstance a lot more frequently. So, yes, I would like to stay in Manchester! Great. Thank you very much for talking to us. Yes - thank you.\n",
            "Hi, Jordan. Hi. Thanks for talking to me today. Erm. What would you like to talk about? Today I was going to talk about music and, erm, how it's changed in terms of distribution and influence on social media in today's generation. Great. Erm, so, I'm a big fan of music. I grew up listening to it on the radio and my mum's old CDs in the car. And, erm, it's funny how growing up you see how in today's digital age and generation, how music is distributed and shared. Erm, when I was young and my parents were young, you'd only ever hear music on the radio or on television on Top of the Pops. But nowadays, music gets shared around all the time on YouTube and Twitter and Instagram. As an artist myself, I found it really interesting how, erm, songs are going viral and acts are breaking not from a prime slot on a television show but just by, erm, music gaining heat online, getting shared around and numbers exponentially growing. Er, it's also made things very difficult because the pool's so much bigger now - everybody's doing it. Er, but, equally, you could have a hit in your bedroom as some, many people, many artists are. They have one song that goes online, a DJ ends up playing it in a club and, er, it goes viral overnight. And it's a great, and a lot of people are making a career that way, erm, which I just find really interesting. As a musician myself, I'm making a lot more of my music from a home studio because it's more accessible for a lot more people now. Do you think the changes are for the better or for the worse? Er, I'm interested to see how it goes. I think in many ways it's a good thing because it opens lots of doors to many people that otherwise wouldn't be able to afford studio time and being able to get their creativity in the best possible format it can be. But, equally, I think there are negatives to it because the opportunities are getting less and less, and people's interests and hopes for instant gratification are having a detrimental effect on the ability of making new music. Erm, there's not much time given to be able to really make your craft and sonically engage in an audience 'cause you don't have long enough, you don't have their attention long enough, for them to really listen and invest in your development. Right. And what, which is your favourite platform for putting your music out? My favourite platform is YouTube because, erm, that's where most of my subscribers are, and what I do is every week on my channel I put out covers of my most favourite songs and the most famous artists of the songs that are doing really well. So that's how I'm able to garner more fans and subscribers over to my channel, so they can hear more of my music and through that they are able to hear my original music as well. Uh huh. Do you want to mention the name of your channel in case our listeners want to subscribe? Sure. My channel's called JordanClarke500, erm Clarke with an 'e'? Yes, it's JordanClarke 500. Ha ha. You'll find covers and some original material on there. And you can find out more about me. So, yeah, please check it out! Great. Thanks so much, Jordan. Thank you.\n",
            "My hero isn't very famous, but she ought to be. She's Mary Anning, who was only 12 years old and from a poor family when she made an amazing discovery. She found the first dinosaur skeleton, that of an ichthyosaur, on the cliffs of Lyme Regis in the south of England. That was in 1811, and until then people had thought that it was impossible for an animal to become extinct. Because she was a woman and didn't have enough money for a proper education, she wasn't able to take part properly in the scientific community of the time. But she read as much scientific literature as she could and continued to search for fossils, often risking her own life to get them by climbing dangerous cliffs. She once nearly died in a landslide which killed her dog. Although she didn't write famous books about fossils, her contribution to palaeontology, the study of fossils, is said to be enormous. I admire her because she kept on trying to make new discoveries at a time when usually only men, and men with money, were allowed to be scientists. After her death the writer Charles Dickens said that 'the carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it'. My hero is Kailash Satyarthi, who has been campaigning against child slavery for years. He is from India and first became aware of the problem of children working when he was 6 and noticed that a boy younger than himself had to spend all day polishing shoes and was unable to go to school. When he was 11, he began to collect money to help buy textbooks for other children, and when he was 26 he gave up his job as an electrical engineer to fight child slavery in India, by doing things like raiding factories where children were forced to work, making rugs or glass bottles. He introduced a programme first called RugMark, now known as Goodweave, which puts tags on child-labour-free rugs made in factories. He has saved many thousands of children, over 80,000, from a terrible life of enforced labour in South Asia and helped them to get an education. He has often been physically attacked for helping children, for example for trying to free Nepalese children forced to work in a circus. He regularly risks his life to fight injustice; two of his colleagues have been murdered. I believe that the best thing he has done is to change how people think about child slavery and to make it an international issue. I'm really interested in ecology and my hero, or heroine, is Rachel Carson because she first got people thinking about the way we humans are causing permanent damage to the Earth's ecosystems. She began as a biologist, specialising in writing about the sea, but she gradually became aware of the danger of using pesticides like DDT and the way they can harm the whole of the food chain, from the worm to humans! She wrote her classic book Silent Spring in 1962 to explain this to the general public, to explain how humans and nature are interdependent. The title of Silent Spring refers to the fact that one day all the birds might be dead so they won't be able to sing in the springtime. The agricultural and chemical industries reacted very badly to the book and said she was unprofessional. But further research by other scientists proved that she was right about the dangers of chemicals used to kill insects. Nowadays there is a growing movement for organic food production, but unfortunately things in general are still getting worse, rather than better. We still need to read Rachel Carson's book and think about its message. My choice of hero isn't very original, I'm afraid, but he's the person I would most like to have met: John Lennon. He died a long time before I was born, and his most famous songs were written long before that, but when I listen to his music I really feel as if he's speaking to me personally. I love the whole range of the Beatles' music, from the early pop songs to the very experimental music at the end of their time as a group. John Lennon was the most innovative writer in the Beatles and he continued to create exciting music when he left and went solo. But although I love his music, what I admire about him is his dedication to universal peace. It's amazing that the song Imagine, written in 1971, is still incredibly popular after all this time. It's about a world where everyone can be equal, a world with no wars, no divisions between countries, no greed, no hunger, no material possessions... I'd like to meet him because he was a lifelong rebel, and although he could be a difficult person, he was original, clever and funny. It was awful that he was killed in 1980 when he was only 40. I wonder what he would be doing if he was alive now.\n",
            "I'd like to talk about my two cats, who are called Misha and Masha, and they're nine years old. And because I work for the British Council and I've worked in lots of different parts of the world, they're quite international cats. So they were born in St Petersburg, Russia, around the dawn of the millennium, in the middle of winter. And St Petersburg winters are very, very cold, so it's kind of minus 30 degrees, and some friends of mine found these two tiny little kittens in the snow and brought them in and then sent an email around the office saying 'Who can look after these two cats?' And my wife and I already had two cats at the time, from Indonesia, and we thought can we... have we got room... can we adopt these two new cats? And then when we saw them, they were just so cute that we couldn't say no. So we brought them home and so they lived with us for, like, two years in Russia. And then we moved back to the UK and they had to stay in France for six months, erm, just to check that they didn't have rabies... erm, before they were allowed into the UK. And then they lived with us in Cambridge and we had a cat flap so they used to wander about it. When it came to leave the UK, we discovered that they'd in fact had about five or six different homes and had made friends with all kinds of people along the street and used to go and get fed and get stroked and cuddled by all of our neighbours. Then we moved to Mexico and we had a house with a garden so we had to build a special fence that kind of curled in on itself so that the cats would climb up and then feel that they were starting to fall down so they'd climb back down again. And then we moved to Guangzhou this time last year. So now they are 'flat cats', erm, they've not been squashed, they just live in our flat, live in our apartment and they don't go out. They just go out onto the balcony. But the interesting thing is that their personality has... seems to have changed in every country they've lived in. So Masha used not to be very friendly towards people. As she's got older, she's now quite a cuddly cat. And they've adapted to living, to being kind of free to roam about and then being in the garden and now they seem to be very happy just being in a flat.\n",
            "Welcome to Tech Today! This week it's National Science and Engineering Week, so to celebrate we asked Jed our science correspondent to give us a round-up of new inventions. Hi, yes, I've got some very interesting things to tell you about today, starting with a fun one: wingsuits, those suits that look like bats and allow people to fly, or glide, at least. They're the ultimate in cool. But they're not very new, are they? Well, no, but the modern ones are better than ever and last October was the first ever world championship in China. The price is coming down, too. Now you can buy one for 600 to 2,000 dollars. It's still too expensive for me, but I suppose it'll keep coming down. OK, what about useful new inventions? There are lots of those. There's a new solar water distiller created by Gabriele Diamanti aimed at parts of the world where it's hard to get clean drinking water. You pour in salty water and let the sun do the work for a few hours. Then, hey presto! You have clean water! It's a very simple device and fairly cheap to produce. Can I hear some doubt in your voice? Well, they still need help with investment to start producing the distiller properly. So if anyone out there has money to invest in a great product? Absolutely. Get in touch with the designers. Another useful invention which it would be good to see in production are 'enable talk gloves'. These were invented by some Ukrainian students to allow people with speech and hearing impairments to communicate with people who don't understand sign language. The gloves use sensors to translate sign language into text, then into spoken language using a smartphone. A brilliant invention! Yes, that could benefit thousands of people. Another useful invention comes from a surprising source, James Cameron, the film director. The Titanic director? The very same. Cameron was part of a team, headed by engineer Ron Allum, which designed the Deepsea Challenger Submarine, capable of descending to the lowest parts of the sea, 10 km down. Last year Cameron went down to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the sea in the world. He was the first person to do a solo dive there, and he stayed for three hours, the longest time so far. That sounds impressive! Yes. We know so little about what's at the bottom of the ocean, and it's important to find out more. OK, so now for something useful in a different way. You know that feeling when you're trying to get tomato ketchup out of a bottle and it won't come out, but you're sure there's lots more in there? Yeah, of course. It's really annoying. Well, a team of students at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have come up with a new product that you use to coat a glass or plastic bottle, and then what's inside, hair gel or mustard, or whatever, comes out really easily. So, it saves hours of frustration trying to get stuff out of bottles? Exactly. Right, now for my favourite invention. This is really silly, but I love it. It's a way of producing clouds indoors. Clouds? Yes. A Dutch artist has come up with a way of forming perfect, small, white clouds inside. They're just beautiful. I don't think you can do it yourself at home yet, though. I don't think I'd want to. Oh, you would if you'd seen the photos. They're amazing. OK, Jed, thanks for that. We'll leave you with your head in the clouds and see you again next week!\n",
            "Hello, sales department. This is Ayako speaking. How can I help you? Hi, Ayako, this is Sam from Events-4-U. I'm calling about the piano you want at your Christmas party next month. Oh, good. It would be a great surprise to have one there for our boss for the night. He can play and it would be a great addition for the party. Have you been able to source one? Well, yes, I have, but But what? Well, we're going to either have an issue with the logistics or the budget, or possibly both. Oh dear. Well, we've found a baby grand piano, as you requested, and it's available for the date you want. OK, great. So what's the issue? Is it too expensive? No, it's within the budget you gave me, so everything there is OK. But it's too wide for the entrance doorway into the building. Oh, I see. So what are our options? Could we dismantle it outside and reassemble it inside? Er, no. Unfortunately, you can't really do that with pianos. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find some inventive solution. Do you have any ideas? Well, we could hoist it up to the first-floor balcony. The door there would be large enough to fit it through. Great. That sounds like a good plan. That would work, though it would increase the cost considerably as we'd need a crane, an extension on the insurance policy and probably two to three additional people to manage getting it successfully into the building. Oh, I see. Well, we can definitely stretch the budget by about ten per cent, but we shouldn't go over that. If we exceed the budget by more than ten per cent, then other areas of the party budget will have to be cut. And we don't really want that. OK, so this idea won't work then. Sorry if I wasn't being clear. The considerable budget increase I was referring to would add a further fifty per cent. You know, cranes are expensive. Oh um OK. So what other options do we have? Well, how fixed are you on the piano being a baby grand? Would an upright piano be an option? Hmm. I don't know. It would fit through the door on the ground floor and cause fewer problems. I've also got the option on a really nice white vintage upright piano, with black design work. OK. That sounds like it might work. Could you send me over some photos of it? I'll do it now, together with the rental and delivery information and costs. Great. Thanks, Sam. Let me think about it and I'll call you back later today. Sure, no problem. I'll wait for your call.\n",
            "The idea of, you know, posting and have a lot of people see it can definitely be kind of scary. You know, if you're a teenager, you're going to make bad decisions sometimes. They can screenshot it, they can do so many things to save that and they can edit it in ways that you won't want them to. Whether or not you think it'll go away, it's there. Anything you post online, you're stuck with. Oversharing to me is putting too much of your personal life in front of a wide audience of people. Posting something for the sake of showing that you're there and maybe not because you're actually having that great of a time. Posting about things that people don't necessarily think are significant, but they're just kind of posting to be posting. What you share and how often you share is going to affect the way that somebody views you. Just because I'm gonna post all the time, that doesn't mean that you're going to get all the attention. That doesn't mean that everybody's gonna like you. For example, people have, like, finstas where they or spam accounts where they just, like, post random stuff and sometimes they get too personal with what with what they're talking about on there. Things that are meant to be texted one-to-one, people will tend to post online so 50 other people can see their plans for tomorrow or the next weekend. You could be doing something, like, that could potentially endanger yourself by making your account public and saying too much about where you live or who you are. When I'm in, like, a cool location, and I want to show everybody where I am, but most of the time I'll just tag where I am on like a Snapchat story so people can know. So once you put something online, it can be there forever because people might take screenshots, they might record it, they might save it. I don't think, I don't think people don't realise that it's going to be there forever. I think they just don't care. A lot of people have this mentality of, like, 'What I'm doing is very insignificant. Why is anyone gonna care about this?' You should be cautious of what you post. You'll post your pictures and think, like, 'OK, nobody, nobody's seeing me, nobody's screenshotted me, nobody doing nothing', because people are doing that. You're just not gonna know. Your Snapchats, despite the fact that they only last, I don't know, four to eight seconds, they're still there. Your Instagram stories that go away after 24 hours, they're still there. Anything that is posted, anything that's up, no matter what happens, even if you leave it up for a minute and take it down, it's there as soon as you put it up there. No one's going to scrutinise everything that you say the same way that you might. You are not obliged to post every second of your life in order to please what you might seem is the majority of people. So when you feel like you have to post all the time, when you feel like you have to do this in order to get fame and attention, you don't. It's not your job. That's something you always have to be thinking about: what do you want people to remember you on social media as?\n",
            "When I was at university, I did a business course that covered advertising, marketing, sales and public relations. I'm really glad I did this particular course as, although it was vast, it gave me an overview of business in general and the different careers in communications. While I was studying, I realised that I was most interested in public relations, and so I joined a couple of associations so I could start networking before leaving university. Through one of the organisations I joined, I was able to meet lots of experienced professionals, who gave me advice on getting into the industry. I was also offered an internship in my final year. This meant I could build up my portfolio even before I'd finished studying. I think that it's extremely important, especially today when there are so many people wanting to work in PR, to do an internship to a) get a foot in the door and b) have more on your CV than simply your studies. You have to show willing and prove that you're an enthusiastic, ambitious person who wants to succeed. It was hard studying and working at the same time, but at least it prepared me for the deadlines and long hours you're expected to put in with a PR job. My internship also meant that I built up a list of contacts in the media and PR industry itself. Both areas were very important in helping me get my first job as an account co-ordinator with a corporate public relations agency. I had to write and proofread flyers, keep track of media databases and other admin-type stuff. It wasn't the most exciting of jobs, but at least it gave me a better insight into PR and helped me decide what I wanted to do after. I didn't have much journalism experience either before working for this company, so I learned that as I went along. After about nine months, when I felt ready to tackle something a bit meatier, I applied for a job, still within the same company, with more responsibility. I became an account executive and very quickly felt at home in my new job. That was about two years ago. I've much more contact with our clients and I play a large role in developing public relations strategies. I still do a lot of writing with press releases, but I'm also more involved in organising special events like press conferences. I love what I do because I get to meet loads of different, interesting people every day. You have to be quite outgoing and able to communicate easily, which I guess is more of a talent than a skill. If I had to start again I'd choose to do a journalism option at university, as employers like you to have a journalism background. Otherwise, getting an internship was the best thing I've ever done and I'd do it again, no problem.\n",
            "I want to talk about Radiohead. For anyone who doesn't know, they are a five-piece indie band from Oxford, England. I first started to like them since 1997, when they released OK Computer that year. And actually, I bought their album out of scepticism because I used to like to watch this TV programme by this DJ called Wong Chi Chung. And in his programme, he just said that 'It's not the end of the year, but I have to announce that OK Computer is the best album of the year.' And so I just wanted to try and listen to this album to see if it is that great. And after I bought it, I just think that 'Wow! This is real music!' because it's musically and lyrically great. And Thom Yorke, the frontman of Radiohead, just write songs like a poems and I think he is very honest and he writes great poetic imageries in the songs. And at that time I just discovered that there are actually many possibilities in music. And they actually started my interest in other genres of music, like ambient, electronic and psychedelic rock and something like that. They not just open my eyes to music, they also open my eyes to the world. For example, I didn't know there is... there was a profession called 'graphic design' beforehand. And I just think that their album cover is very good. And later I learned that the cover was made by a graphic designer who is also the band's friend. And then at that time I started to take interest in this field and eventually I got a bachelor degree for it. They have also widened my horizons to the fullest because they are a very socially responsible band. They care about the Third World debts, fair trade, poverty, global warming and the environment. And they make me think about all these world issues that I have never thought about before. They encourage me to make a difference. This kind of thing, I just think that not any band in the music scene has this guts to care about. And also, actually, contrary to general belief that Radiohead is depressing, Thom Yorke the frontman is always whining, I actually think that their music is very uplifting and soothing. And also Thom Yorke has heavenly voices. I actually think that their music give me, gives me comfort in the darkest days of my life. And no other band can give me the same powerful consolation than Radiohead. And I think they are the greatest band and always will be.\n",
            "So, as we have seen, then, relationship-building is not the same as team-building. When we talk about relationship-building, we're talking about a competency in which we cultivate relationships both inside and outside the workplace, with individuals and groups. I'm going to sum up by suggesting practical ideas of how you can all develop your relationship-building competency... tips that you can easily incorporate into your day-­to-­day lives in such a way that they will eventually become a habit. I'm going to talk about informal relationships, but as we discussed earlier, the ideas can be transferred to a more formal environment. First I'll talk about initiating new relationships and then I'll mention a few ways that you can practise developing existing relationships. Let's start off with the obvious. Common sense is always a good starting point. The first thing we should all do is to practise simple courtesies. This might seem like common sense to some people, but in actual fact you'd be surprised at how many people do neglect these things. Set yourself a goal to say 'Good morning' to three people you normally wouldn't. We should also try to get to know colleagues outside the office. Ask people what their interests are. If you share an interest in tennis, say, suggest a game. Plan an occasional social event with co­-workers. It doesn't have to be anything complicated - a coffee together or a picnic lunch, for example. Another thing you can do is to actually target somebody in your office - somebody you would like to know better. Make it your goal to talk to them. Small talk is fine. Listen to what they say and take notice of the information you learn about their interests. Make sure you keep yourself up to date on what's happening in the world too. You won't be very good at small talk if you don't know about current affairs. So let's imagine that we've done these things and that we've started a few new relationships. What can we do to develop them further? How can we nurture the relationships so they don't just fizzle out or stay on a plane? Well, for a start we should focus on a person's good qualities and not on their deficiencies. Nobody's perfect, after all. We should also practise effective listening. We are all good at speaking, but how many of us really listen? And people want to be listened to. They appreciate it and they respond. Try it! If we are in a conflictive situation with somebody, we should focus on the issue and not on the person. So, we can hammer out a point of disagreement, but then shake hands and go for a coffee. Usually it is an issue that is the problem and not a person. Choose somebody who you consider to be an acquaintance and make a point of learning something new about his or her interests. Think of some questions that you can ask them for when you next meet. Finally, when you are talking to people with whom you have a relationship of some kind, get into the habit of asking open­-ended questions. That way they'll be able to give their points of view. Sometimes people just need to have the chance to say what they think and very often it doesn't happen.\n",
            "Oh, hello, and Merry Christmas! It's Hayley here, with a few yummy Yuletide gift ideas for you to make at home and send with love. First up, when it's cold outside, who doesn't love a good brew? Why not create your own personalised tea? All you need is some empty bags, a few labels and plenty of loose tea leaves to go inside. It's super simple, but choosing from the thousands of different types of tea out there might not be. And if tea isn't on your loved one's Christmas list, how about giving them the gift of the world's greatest hot chocolate? Start by finding a clean, empty jar; any old jar will do. Then you'll need powdered milk, cocoa, chocolate chips and marshmallows. Go on, you as well! Then finish it off by adding a ribbon and a tag. Next up, popcorn garlands - the perfect present to make a special someone's tree pop. Whether it be sweet, salty or cinnamon, for that Christmas twist, all you need - after your popcorn, of course - is a needle, thread and an adult on hand. Simply thread the popcorn together one by one and you get the picture. An edible treat ready for the tree. And finally, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without our gingerbread pals, would it? To make these decorated delights, add plain flour, bicarbonate of soda, ground ginger, cinnamon and butter to a mixing bowl and blend. Once it looks like breadcrumbs, stir in some brown sugar, add an egg and lashings of golden syrup, and mix until you have your gingerbread dough. Leave this in the fridge for 15 minutes, wrapped in cling film, then roll it out and get your cookie cutter going. Pop them in the oven for around 12 minutes, then, once they're cool, it's time to decorate. And there you have it, four delicious homemade treats to spread some joy this Christmas. Now if you'll excuse me, it's party time!\n",
            "Bohdi and Jasmine love to skateboard. I like the good community and I like making friends, but I also like how it's really fun. I kind of got into it because, back in the day, my dad used to skate around a lot. Skateboarding's hard, but I reckon anyone that puts their mind to it, they can easily do it. And you know what? Right now is an exciting time to be a skater. I was very excited to watch the Olympics because there was skateboarding. But before we get to that, let's have a quick look back at the history of skateboarding. The origins of skateboarding can actually be traced here, to surfers in the 1940s and '50s. They wanted a way to practise when there weren't waves, so someone had the bright idea of putting wheels on a wooden board, so you could surf, kind of, on land. At first, people would ride around on footpaths and car parks. Then, in the '70s, there was a terrible drought in Southern California. People had to empty their swimming pools, which became the first-ever skating ramps. From there, the sport took off. 'It takes an almost perfect sense of balance, strong nerves and a smooth, sloping surface. It might look easy, but it requires a great deal of strength and control.' Boards became more sophisticated 'Some kids think timber is the best and some kids think flex is the best.' and more skateparks started popping up. Competitions got big, and pro skaters became superstars. Now it's become a lot more mainstream, so a lot more people skateboard, as you can see here - how many people are actually using the skatepark themselves, whether they're on skateboards or scooters or BMXs, but you see a lot more skateboards. A lot more people are doing it, picking up, giving it a shot and loving it. But the biggest thing to happen in skating for a long time is the Olympics. Not every skater was thrilled about seeing their sport in such a mainstream competition. After all, skating has traditionally been seen as a sport for rebels and free spirits. But for a lot of skaters, it's really inspiring to see the best of the best compete in front of the world, including some of the youngest Olympians ever. We've had two 13-year-olds on the podium and a 16-year-old, which inspires me a lot because they're really young. And I'm 13 in three years, which is probably when the Olympics is going again. And they were competing against a 34-year-old. It was really good to watch young people win medals. Sadly, not all of Australia's skateboarding team could make the Games this year. Back in May, two Aussies and a coach tested positive to Covid at an Olympic qualifying event in the US. But for these guys, it's the chance of a lifetime, and for the rest of Australia's top skaters, well, there's always 2024, 2028 or even Brisbane 2032. We had the right people in the right places, and I think in the future, we'll do it - we'll smash it. And who knows, maybe you'll see these guys up on the Olympic podium one day. Yeah, I'm trying to work hard and get to the Olympics. Yeah. In about, like, a few years. Maybe not the next Olympics, but maybe the one after.\n",
            "Hello and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today it is snowing in Durham so I thought it would be a beautiful chance to film for you and now the sun's come out and it's really lovely, so I'm just going to go on a walk with my friends in the snow and hopefully film some really pretty things for you. So we've come to Wharton Park, which is a park in Durham, near where we live. Um, it's very hilly, so it's perfect for sledging, so, yeah, we've been having some fun on the hills and I'll show you some clips of that now. Hi, guys! We're still in Wharton Park and I wanted to film to show you the beautiful scenery of Durham. As you can see here there's - no don't! . Have a look at the scenery. It's really nice. We're very lucky to... be... living here. Aww, that hit me in the face! So, we finished our walk and we've just been into a pub called The Station House, which is behind me just there. And we had a drink and a sausage roll to warm up, which was very nice. Now we're going to head home, so thank you for watching and I look forward to seeing you in my next video. Bye!\n",
            "Hi, guys! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today I'm with my flatmate, Viktoria. Hi. Do you want to introduce yourself? Say where you're from, what you study at university? Sure. Um, I'm from Hungary. I study art history and literature, and I'm a fourth year, so I finish university this year. Yay! So, today we decided that we wanted to make some sushi for dinner and we thought we would show you guys how we attempt to make vegan sushi. So, I think this is Vicky's first time making sushi, and I've done it a couple of times before, but we'll see how it goes. So, what we have here, erm, is some rice, that we cooked and what do we have here? Avocados, carrots and cucumbers. You can use other vegetables like red peppers or green peppers or yellow. Radish And then the point is that you need to cut it lengthwise, so it's in, like, these little long shapes that you can put in and then roll it up. OK, so here I have my nori, and what you want to do is to put the shiny side facing downwards, so the glossy side of the nori is touching the bamboo, or just the cling film if you're rolling with cling film. Next, I take a bit of water and I just dip my fingers in it and moisten up the nori. This makes it a bit easier to roll. Then, I'm going to take a little bit of rice and put it along the bottom half of the nori, just flattening it down. I always put some extras at the end, because I find that they come out with less stuff - everything is in the middle. OK, so for this stuffing we have carrots and cucumbers. OK, so that's the first wrap - just going to put it to the side. And then afterwards we're going to chop them up. Now, Vicky, it's your go. Your turn to shine! Haha. What is wrong? I thought you didn't know what you were doing. No, I do know what I'm doing! What did you think I was doing? I thought you forgot to put the nori! I did forget! No, I did forget! This can be a California roll, then. You know, where the rice is outside. You still need the nori! Haha. Oh my god! Rewind! I just accidentally put rice without nori. I thought Vicky was, like, knew what she was doing, and was trying to make the rolls. I did, I just forgot. I just forgot to put, like, seaweed under it. So Attempt number two. So, Vicky, what's your favourite food? It's probably sushi. Is it, really? Ah ha. Either sushi or... or just Indian food in general. I like the spices. What's yours? Erm, I have, I think I have a favourite food from different nationalities or, like, different cuisines. I don't think I have one overall favourite food. What's your favourite Hungarian food? Erm, I would say goulash. Haha. How original. Traditional. Traditional, exactly. What's your favourite British food? Erm, I really like sticky toffee pudding. It's a dessert. OK. It's a cake with, um, caramel sauce, so... Mmm. That's nice. It's your go. I think that one came out well. Yeah, that one was a really nice one. What dish would you recommend to cook that is easy if you have people over for dinner? Pasta. I think that's a really safe bet. It's quick and it's filling and you can make a lot of it. So that's what I would cook. Or something with rice, like risotto or something. How about you? Um, I'd probably just say pancakes. Because you can make them savoury, you know, if you, like, add sweetcorn. Or, yeah. Yeah. OK. It's a good idea. But I like pancakes. OK, let's ask a question now about language learning. So, how like, what would you recommend to people who want to learn English as a second language, because English is Vicky's second language. Exactly. Erm, I think the most fun way to learn a language is to watch movies or series. So, that's what I did. I watched a lot of I started with a really difficult series. I started watching Big Bang Theory, um, which has a lot of technical terms and science words that I didn't understand. But then you feel more and more competent and successful when you do understand those words after a while. So, I would recommend watching series, probably. Yeah. And maybe if you're not as ambitious as Vicky, um, start with something simple, or with a series that you've already watched in your native language, um, so you have an idea of what's happening. Yeah. Or add subtitles, even. Yeah, subtitles are good. And what I really like, erm, is watching TED Talks. When I was teaching in Italy I watched a lot of TED Talks with my students because they have subtitles for like 76 languages or something. Yeah. And the talks are really interesting as well. So, these are what our sushi rolls look like and now we're just going to cut them up into small pieces. If you are a younger person, please make sure that you get an adult to help you with this because it can be quite tricky and you're going to need a sharp knife. So, make sure you have someone older helping you out. OK. So, I'm just going to wet the knife a bit so it's easier to cut. OK. You can cut them as big or as small as you want. That's what they look like when they're cut. And they were successful. So, guys, these are the results! Yay! Yippee! Now it's just time to get eating, really. So, guys, it's dinner time! OK, well, we're going to put the chopstick ability to the challenge. Haha. I'm just afraid it will fall apart. Oh no, it didn't, it didn't! OK, I'm going to have some of this sauce. Are you ready for the taste test? Yeah, I am! I don't know how I'm going to put this one in my mouth. Yeah, I don't know. It's... really big. So, guys, comment below and let us know if you've ever made sushi at home, if you like sushi, or if not tell us what your favourite food is. And I hope you've enjoyed watching this video. It's goodbye from us and enjoy your food! Bye! Bye!\n",
            "Hi, Jo. Hello. Thank you for talking to me today. What would you like to talk about? So, I'm going to tell you about my recent visit to, erm, a very well-known restaurant and a very special restaurant. OK - great. It's called El Celler de Can Roca and it's in Girona in Spain and, erm, it often comes in the, like, top two or three restaurants in the world. Wow! And I went last week. And, well, the first thing that was exciting for us was to even get a table 'cause, erm, we booked a year ago and we had to go, you have to go, 'cause you can book a year in advance, so you have to go online at one minute to midnight a year before you think you could go and keep refreshing, refreshing the page until places become available and just go immediately and get the table. So, we were really excited to have the table and we were kind of nervous on Friday because we waited a whole year, so expectations were really high. And it was also, by chance, boiling hot in Girona and it was in the middle of a heatwave. It was 44 degrees. Oh my goodness. So, we were just waiting in our hotel room, couldn't go outside 'cause it was too hot, erm, kind of wondering what this dinner was going to be like, er, and getting all dressed up. So, yeah, we went and, well, the place is beautiful, all I thought it would be quite, erm, it didn't really feel formal though. The staff were all really friendly and they showed us inside the kitchen first. And it's amazing 'cause no one is stressed in the kitchen - or they did a good job of pretending that they weren't. And they were making amazing things that looked like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for adults - little olive trees with amazing, like, erm, er, olive kind of confections hanging from them. And, yeah, the whole thing was amazing - a once-in-a-lifetime experience of lots of different courses of tiny, beautiful, surprising things, erm What was the best dish that you had? It was all amazing but I think the best thing for me was one of the desserts. I had a sheep-themed pudding Wow! So, it was all, erm - So, it was like a woolly sheep. It was like candy floss, like, made with, erm, like, sort of white sugar like you have at the fair. Erm, and that was supposed to represent the wool, and the sound of the spoon on the bowl made the sound of the bell on the sheep in the field. And then separately I had this thing to smell that smelled of wool. So I was, like, eating this sheep wool and smelling the smell of wool at the same time which, it sounds really weird, but it was actually delicious. Sounds incredible! It really was! It really was amazing. Wow. Thank you for telling us about it. It's a pleasure.\n",
            "Now the 2020 Olympics might seem a long way away to you, but people are already talking about what new sports might be included. Today I'm going to talk to two people who are hoping their sport might be included. The first is Jonny Mills whose sport is wakeboarding. Jonny, can you tell us what wakeboarding is? Is it like surfboarding? Well, a bit. It started in California because people wanted to surf but didn't have waves... It's also a bit like waterskiing in that the rider is towed behind a specially-built speed boat. How fast does the boat go? Usually at about 25 mph, or a bit less. The rider uses the wake the board produces in the water to launch into the air. And then you do a lot of complicated things in the air? That's right, spins of up to 1260 degrees, things like that. 1260 degrees, that's impossible isn't it? Oh no, but it's pretty crazy. You spin round three and a half times in the air. And then you have to land again without falling over. You'll have to come and watch some wakeboarding if you haven't seen any. Come to Wakestock in July if you can. That's in Wales, isn't it? Yep, Abersoch in North Wales. It's a really popular wakeboarding and music festival. It's right by the beach. It's not quite the same as California, but it's cool. It attracts a lot of great riders. Who does wakeboarding? They reckon about 3 million people all over the world. More guys do it, but there are increasing numbers of girls too. The people who compete are usually in their teens or twenties, but anyone can do it. There's a lot of crossover with other board sports like surfing and skateboarding. The tricks people pull are similar and the names for things are often the same. And looking at you, I'd say the fashion was similar too. Yeah, the clothes and the lifestyle are similar. Right, now I'd like to ask Jules Russell about her sport. She's a skater in a roller derby team. Tell us about that, Jules. Is it a popular sport? Yes, it's becoming really popular in the UK. There are about 60 leagues in England and 1,200 throughout the world. In the US and Canada, of course, and places like Scandinavia and Australia, but lots of other countries too. The sport began in the States, didn't it? Yes, in the 1930s, but it was more for entertainment than sport and it died out by the 1970s. Then there was a revival in Texas in 2001 and from then on it's just been growing and growing. So how do you play it? Well, you have two teams of five people on roller skates, of course, and they go round an oval track in the same direction. Each team has a \"jammer\" who scores points by passing members of the opposing team. They do whatever they can to stop her, within reason. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins. It sounds a bit rough! Well, it's a contact sport, so there's bound to be a lot of pushing and falling over. It's all good fun, though; people don't often get hurt. If you try and trip someone up you get penalised. You do try and frighten the other team a bit though. That's right. You have frightening clothes and special names. People used to have incredible costumes a couple of years ago. Now the sport is changing and becoming more professional. Lots of the teams train three or four times a week, and spend a lot of time in the gym you have to be really dedicated and fit. We still have nicknames, though. I'm “The Julifier”. And is the sport all female? There are a few men who do it, but it's mostly female and amateur at the moment. Things are changing fast though, so who knows what the future will bring. It would be fantastic to be an Olympic sport. What do you think about roller derby, Jonny? It's wild! Those ladies scare me to death! Good luck to them with the Olympics thing though. And good luck to us too. Good luck to you both.\n",
            "Superhuman speed jaw-dropping agility genius-level intellect and, of course, those unique spidey-senses There's no doubt that Spider-Man is one of the best superheroes ever created. And that this definitely isn't him. The person we have to thank for Spider-Man's existence is this guy: American comic-book writer, editor and publisher Stan Lee. And Spider-Man's not the only hero Stan brought to life. Not by a long shot. He's also responsible for the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men, Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther, the Fantastic Four the list goes on. Back in the 1930s and 40s, when these iconic characters were nothing more than a twinkle in young Stan's eye, it wasn't the big screens that captivated superhero fans. No, it was the golden age of comic books. In 1939, Stan began his career as an assistant with a very small publisher called Timely Comics. But it wasn't until the 60s that he first put his biggest creations to paper. By then, the little publisher had rebranded. And you might recognise the name it went with. In the 60s, Marvel characters were brought to life as live action and animated heroes in movies and on TV screens. Today, it's a multimedia giant owned by Disney and it's worth billions of dollars pumping out slickly produced blockbusters full of recognisable faces. And - fun fact - as many Marvel fans will already know, over the years, Stan snuck short cameo appearances into dozens of Marvel movies. A game of hide-and-seek that never failed to excite his fans. Those fans say it's really sad to say bye to Stan. He's kind of the one who taught me to read a little bit, you know? He's like, one of the greatest of all times. The father of comic books. He was 95 but to us he's a superhero. Could live as long as he wanted to. As do the celebs who have been lucky enough to play his characters on the big screen. He was incredibly kind and generous and the most enthusiastic person that I've ever met on set. And you guys told us he meant a lot to you as well. It was pretty sad to hear he'd died, especially seeing, um, mainly because he was the original creator. Stan Lee was a very successful man. He created a big franchise that made billions and billions of dollars. And it's been able to connect with me and heaps of other children. Critics say what always sets Stan's superheroes apart was that they're not perfect. They're all flawed and have real-life problems their powers can't solve. I guess you could say Stan's superpower was showing us, through his characters, that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Oh, help! Help! Anyone? Help! Well, most people.\n",
            "This is Stratford-upon-Avon, a town that gets millions of visitors every year, thousands per day, and they all come for one reason William Shakespeare. I'm Ben Crystal, an actor and stage producer of Shakespeare's plays. I'm here to find out why this small town in the centre of England produced one of the country's best-ever playwrights, and why people are still visiting Stratford-upon-Avon 400 years after Shakespeare's death. When shall we three meet again In thunder, lightning or in rain? When the hurly burly's done, When the battle's lost and won. I just love Shakespeare, always have, as a little kid too. Romeo and Juliet - it was a love story and it was very romantic. He has the ability to show into the heart, into the soul of the human beings. They are kind of cross-cultural, you know. Everyone and everywhere you go, people put on Shakespearian shows. There is a timelessness to it. I'm starting my journey at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, where in 1564 Shakespeare was baptised, and then, 52 years later, buried. The words you can see in black and white are actually written on his grave. They're a curse warning us never to move his bones. This statue was created soon after Shakespeare's death. We think he looked very similar to this when he was alive. The next part of my journey takes me to Shakespeare's family home. This is the house where Shakespeare was born in April 1564, just upstairs in one of the bedrooms. They seem to be in a big, nice house. They seem to be doing well. What did his father do? Shakespeare's father was actually a glove maker. And he did not only live in this house, he also worked in here. He worked here? Yes, so it's not just a family home, it's also his workplace. His father was a craftsman, and William Shakespeare probably helped his father in the glove workshop, so he would have learned the trade of a glove maker himself. And he also managed to get quite a lot of references into his plays about gloves and leather making. Romeo and Juliet - 'Oh that I were a glove upon that hand'. We're pretty sure Shakespeare came to school here - at King Edward's, just around the corner from the family home. William was able to attend this school for free because his father was a town councillor. What do you think of that? Oh my goodness! What type of education would he have received here? They would have taught you how to write here, how to read, but as you got later up into the school, then the teaching was all about Latin and Greek, translating Latin and Greek into English, and writing speeches, writing stories. Would you say that the education he received here shows in his plays, in his poetry? Absolutely, undoubtedly. The plays are full of all those classical references, and all those great stories from Latin and Greek classical literature. Most successful playwrights of the time went to university, but Shakespeare didn't. He left King Edward's at 15, around the same time his father began to have financial difficulties. Did it harm Shakespeare's career as a playwright that he didn't go to university? Well, we think perhaps the opposite. At university you were taught how to write plays, so his style when he came into writing plays was completely new. The text had that lovely lyrical style; it's beautiful poetry. And all the stories that he'd learnt here at the school were put into his plays. He certainly broke through this whole formal way of making plays, and suddenly a new way of looking at theatre is opened up for everybody to come and see.\n",
            "Stratford in Shakespeare's time was a busy place. It was a market town, people would have travelled far and wide to be here, bringing their life stories with them. If Shakespeare heard them they would have fired his imagination and been great ground for play writing. At 18 William married a local woman, Anne Hathaway, who was eight years older than him. Anne was three months pregnant on their wedding day, so six months later she gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Susanna. And two years after Susanna, twins were born, Hamnet and Judith, a boy and a girl. So he's twenty-two, and he's got three children and a wife. It's a lot of pressure on him. And between having his three children and turning up in London a few years later in the 1590s, Shakespeare goes missing. There is no record of him. So those years in between are called the lost years and there are lots of strange ideas about what Shakespeare did during those lost years. What are some of your favourite ideas about where he went, what happened to him over these years? I think that William was inspired by travelling groups of actors who came to visit Stratford-upon-Avon when he was living here, and I think that he saw some of their plays when they set up in the streets and in the taverns, and he thought that's for me and travelled to London with them. Did Stratford have a great influence on his writing? Stratford had a really important influence on Shakespeare's writing. He was inspired by the tradespeople he saw here, the schoolmasters, and especially the countryside. He writes a lot about trees and forests and flowers and herbs in all of his plays, so he is inspired by all of the things that are happening around him. There are so many questions we have about Shakespeare that we'll never get answers to, but coming here to Stratford, seeing where he grew up, where he went to school, where he was buried, it brings the man that most of us were introduced to in a book on a page back to life. Where the place? Upon the heath. There to meet with Macbeth.\n",
            "Help! Somebody help me! ... Please! Help! Help! There's someone here! Oh my gosh, we've got a survivor here! There's a survivor here! Someone give me a hand! ... Be careful! Ready? One. Two. Three! ... OK. You're going to be OK. Stay with me. Hang in there... Hang in there. Oh no. No, no, no, no. We're losing her! ... Her heart's stopped! Get me the defibrillator, now! ... Clear! ... Clear! and police are still looking into the mysterious accident involving a small private aeroplane. The plane crashed while taking off from a local airport at 10 p.m. last night. Witnesses say they saw the plane take off and then crash into a nearby field. There are reports of two people dead, and one in critical condition. Officials report that they do not yet know the cause of the crash, but it looks like the pilot lost control of the aeroplane. We'll have more updates on this breaking story as it comes in... Good morning! And how are we this morning? ... You're very lucky, you know. Not everybody can survive a plane crash. And here you are. You're the only survivor, in fact. The doctors said that they couldn't find any identification on you at the crash site. Everything was burning. But you're going to be OK, don't worry... The doctors also say they don't know if you can hear anything or not. I don't know either, but I enjoy talking so I think I'll keep talking to you if that's OK. Is that OK? ... Well, as I was saying, we don't have any ID for you. You're a mystery! So, at the moment, we have to give you a name. Jane Doe... I'm going to put your name as Jane Doe on the papers at the moment, but it's only temporary. When you wake up, you can tell me your real name. OK? ... Oh, I forgot to tell you my name! How rude of me. So, my name is Jenny Bryson. I'm your nurse. I'm originally from England, but I've lived here for six years. I like it here... Do you like it here, Jane? Not in this hospital, obviously... but in this town? In this part of America? Hmmm. Actually, are you from here? ... That's OK. You can tell me when you wake up.

Out on the street with all the bad guys. Yes, Agent Sanders. I'm happy to be here. Just a quick question: who am I working with? You're working with me. I'm your partner and, for the moment, I'm also going to be your boss. Are we all clear on that? Yes. Crystal clear. Of course, I just didn't think You just didn't think what? Nothing. So, what are we going to do today? Well, as I said. This is the Bank Robbery Department of the Bureau. Yes. So today we are going to catch some bank robbers! \t... Good morning, Jane! And how are you this morning? ... You have a visitor, Jane, Agent Kowalski, from the FBI. I don't understand why they need to be here now, but he said he had to see you. I won't let him bother you though too much, OK? ... Now, I told you that she shouldn't be disturbed. She's still asleep. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm afraid I have to see her though. I won't be long. Just don't you bother my Jane. Jane? Yes, Jane Doe. It's the name we gave her... We don't know her real name. How is she? Well, you should ask the doctor. She is very lucky to be alive. She's in a coma, but her brain doesn't show any sign of damage and her body is healing. Can she hear us? We don't know. They say that some people like this can hear everything. Other people can't hear anything. We don't know. Did she have anything with her? Where are her things? She only had some clothes on when she got here. No identification or purse. No phone. I'm going to have to take her fingerprints, OK? Well... OK. If you must. I'm afraid so. So... was she on the plane? We found her very near the place where the plane crashed, yes. But was she a passenger? The doctor told me there were only two people on the plane. They were both men. They are both dead. Erm... I'm not really allowed to say any more. That should be enough. Thank you, Nurse... Bryson. Nurse Bryson. Well, Nurse Bryson. That will be all for today. If she wakes up, will you please let us know? Of course. Actually, could you please give my colleague your details? Name, phone number, just for the record. OK... Just go outside for a moment and see my colleague. His name's Scott. He's just outside. I can't really leave the patient here alone... She won't be alone. I'll be here, I just need to make a couple of notes. OK, then... 'Jane Doe', huh? ... You can hear me, can't you? ... I know your real name, Agent Sanders... I'll see you around, Jane.

Not yet. Just give me another 24 hours. We're partners, Sanders. You can't keep me in the dark like this... This is not a secure line. We don't use names. Whatever. Fine. Have you found the money?

Can I help you? My name is Officer Brian Garner. I'm with the local sheriff's department. Sorry it took so long for someone to come out here. That's quite all right, officer. What can we do to help? I'm here to see your mystery patient, and ask you a few questions. Well, I've already told your friend from the FBI everything. FBI? Friend? What are you talking about? Agent Kowalski. The young man who was here yesterday. Hmm. Strange... Nobody told us this. Did this Agent Kowalski show you any identification? Yeess... I think so. I didn't pay much attention though. I mean, I've never seen an FBI identification badge before, so what would I know? Don't worry. The FBI never tell us anything. Let's talk about your patient. Do you have any identification for her here? Clothes, personal items, jewellery? Anything like that? There were some clothes, yes. But no identification. We think it all burned. We're calling her Jane Doe for the moment. Hmm. Jane Doe. OK. Listen. Here's my card. If those guys from the FBI show up, can you give me a call? It would be good to share any information you find. Of course. I wonder... What is it? Do you think Jane is in trouble? I don't know. But I wonder if this whole thing is connected with the big bank robbery a few months ago. Robbery? Yeah. A couple of months ago a bank truck carrying over two million dollars was robbed on the side of the highway. It was a professional job, by an organised gang. The criminals were never caught, and the money disappeared. But what does that have to do with Jane? The last place the truck was seen was near that airport. And the FBI was here. They follow bank robberies. Well, it's probably nothing. Just a coincidence. You'd be surprised how many coincidences we get in police work. Anyway, I'll let you get back to work. Good afternoon.\n",

I was there, for the robbery. And I saw where they kept the money and I took it. Anyway, I'm getting out of here tonight. It's over. I can help you. Let me help you. I can bring you in. Are you trying to tell me you can protect me? No, no, no. You don't understand. These guys don't just rob banks. They kill people. And they have someone working in the FBI. Two million dollars is a lot of money, OK? I think that will keep me safer than your... protection. Wait... I just came here to say goodbye because I like you, OK? But if they knew I was talking to a cop, they'd kill me. And if they knew I was talking to a cop AND I stole their money... No way. I'm getting out of here. See you later, Sanders. Wait! Wait! Hello, Agent Sanders... I know you can hear me... Don't worry. I thought we could have a little chat. Just you and me. I need you to wake up, Agent Sanders. I need you to wake up and tell me where the money is... You see, I know it was either you or that scumbag Buddy who took the money... Because guess what? There wasn't any money on the plane. That means someone hid it somewhere before the plane took off... I need to find the money. I'm in trouble with some dangerous people, Sanders. The people that robbed that bank. If I get the money for them, everything will be OK... And I think you know where the money is. Do you know where it is? ... I know you can't speak. But perhaps you can move your finger. Here... let me just put my phone here, under your hand. I want you to tap the phone. One tap means yes. Two taps means no... Do you understand me? ... You can hear me, Sanders. And I think you can move a finger. Answer me... Fine. Maybe I'll have better luck if I talk to your little brother... You think I don't know about your little brother? The only family you have left? Oh, we know about him. Poor kid, his sister an FBI agent who he hardly ever sees, both parents dead, living on his own in New York City... Maybe I'll pay him a visit and talk to him. Maybe he's... stronger than you are... If you don't answer me right now, I'm getting on a plane to New York. You know what I'll do, right? ... Good. Good. Let's get started. Hello? Excuse me, what are you doing here? I'm Agent Kowalski, FBI. Just checking in on the patient here. It's 10 p.m. There are no visitors allowed now. Of course... Of course. I'll come back later then. Sorry, I didn't realise the time. Shall I ask security to show you out? No, that won't be necessary. I can find my own way out. Thank you, nurse. And, well, goodbye for now... Jane.\n",

We're moving now, but it takes a bit of time. Hey, I paid you to fly this thing outta here. Quickly. And we're still on the ground. OK, we're taking off. You know that most crashes happen on take-off, right? I assume you don't want to crash? Just fly. Hey, there's a door open. In the back how did that... Stop right there! What the? My name is Agent Sanders. I'm with the FBI. I want you to stop this plane right now. Are you crazy? I told you. I TOLD you they were going to kill me. How did you find me? It wasn't hard, Buddy. I followed you here. Yeah, and jumped on my plane! Well, if you're so smart you know I don't have the money with me. I know. But I also know where you hid it. So how about we turn this plane around, go back to the city and talk about this. No way. Man, do NOT listen to her. Just take off. Take off now. Listen, I don't want any trouble... If you aren't gonna take off, then move over! Stop it! What are you doing? I'm not going back! I don't care... Don't touch that, don't... Uh... huh... hello? Jane? Oh my gosh, you're awake. You're finally awake! Let me go and get the doctor! Wait Wait What? Help. I need your help. It's very dangerous. What do you mean? The FBI agent. He isn't... he's a criminal. Very dangerous.

He took it from right under your noses. Anyway, I managed to track him down Yes, I followed him! But I couldn't catch him. He got on a plane! A little plane, out here in the countryside. He can't go far. He's probably trying to go across the border, but he isn't going to make it. I'll make sure of that Yes. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. And I'll take care of Sanders too.

Hey. Hey! It's going down. I gotta go. I gotta go. Hello? Hello, I'm trying to reach Agent Kowalski. This is Agent Kowalski. Oh, hello. This is Nurse Bryson. Agent Kowalski, you told me to call you if there was a change with Jane. Well, there has been a change. It's not very good, I'm afraid. What's happened? She's woken up. She has? But but that's wonderful. Yes, but she's still in critical condition. She's awake now, but she's confused. She doesn't really know who she is or where she is. The doctors want to put her back into a coma, but I thought you might want to talk to her first. You see, she... she might not survive. Listen. It's crucial that you keep her awake. I need to speak to her. I only need five minutes. But do not let her go back to sleep. OK. I'll... I'll try. Nurse? Hello? Yes, in here. I'm with Ja---, I mean Monica. Monica? There's someone here to see you. OK. I have to see some other patients, Agent Kowalski. I only ask that you please do NOT make Monica upset. Her condition is very delicate. Do you understand? I understand. Thank you. I only need a minute. OK, then. So. I suppose I should congratulate you on waking up. Do you have something to tell me? You have to promise me. Promise me my brother will be OK. That depends, Sanders. It depends on if you tell me what I need to know. Promise! All right. All right. I promise. OK? Thank you. You want to know... you want to know about the money. Yes, that's right. You want to know where it is. Yes, I want to know where it is! Stop wasting my time. How long? What? How long what? How long have you been working with that crew of bank robbers on this? What do you mean? Buddy. Buddy told me you were working with them. Said said you'd gone bad. You're corrupt. And you believed him? I'm not working for anyone, Sanders. Sure I was helping the gang but only when it suited me. I'm not really working for them. Not them, not even the government. Not really. I'm just working for myself now. And was it worth it? To do this to the Bureau? To let criminals go free? To threaten my brother? Are you kidding? It's two million dollars. You bet it's worth it. I'd do anything for that. You're wrong... Listen. I'm done talking. Tell me where it is There isn't much time left. You hear that? You are going under again, Sanders. You're going back into a coma. If you want me to save your brother, you tell me right now where the money is. You're... you're... Tell me! You are under arrest, Kowalski. What? What are you talking about? Agent Nick Kowalski, my name is Officer Brian Garner. You are under arrest for attempted robbery, conspiracy and threatening a law enforcement officer. What is going on? It's all here, Kowalski. I have it all recorded. Nurse? I set up the phone, just like you asked me to.  ... Are you kidding? It's two million dollars. You bet it's worth it. I'd do anything for that... Mr Kowalski, you are going to have to come with me. Monica! We did it! What... You're done, Kowalski. Well, enjoy this moment, Sanders. Enjoy it, since it's one of your last. Oh, I don't think so. My Jane, I mean, Monica, is doing quite well. But... Oh, I told you she had only a short time to live? I'm happy to say that's not true. Monica is much better now. She should be on her feet in the next 24 hours. I'll be at your trial, Kowalski. And the money...? We just had a phone call telling us the location of the money. A police car is on its way now. That was me, Kowalski. That's enough now. You're coming with me. I want my lawyer. Get your hands off of me! Well, Monica. That was exciting. It was, wasn't it? What are you going to do now? Now?

            "Kiera, have you heard John isn't coming back and they might even fire him? No! I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons? I'm pretty sure that's not the full story. Have you ever worked with him? A long time ago, but well, I've heard stories about him for years. I've never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it - everybody did. But she saw the notes from the meeting and there was no mention of her name anywhere. John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started - it was that cars one - Susanne was moved to something else. It won an award, didn't it? Yeah, but Susanne didn't get to share it - there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn't do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job. Yeah, it's almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was. How did you find working with him, then? Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I've been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him. Did you ever see him stealing people's ideas? It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it's not easy to say, 'Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.' For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult. I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him. Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn't say anything. Did that happen to you? Not to me, no, but we all knew and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn't have that much contact with him myself. They're doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light. I hope so. I really hope he's not coming back.\n",
            "Hi, guys! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Today I'm with my friend Natasha Hi! who was the one who actually gave me the recipe for those Oreo balls yeah... that I posted in another video, so check that out! But today we're in Berlin and we're here for a couple of days so we wanted to go exploring and bring you guys along with us. So if you want to see what there is to do in Berlin, then stick around! So, can you tell us what we've been up to? So this morning, or I guess it's afternoon, we went to Urban Spree. Urban Spree, and that's this art building that they've made to help keep the graffiti of this area alive and it was a very hipster place with lots of cool little booklets about graffiti, and there are all these shipping containers that they had transferred into restaurants and stuff. So it was kind of cool and there's graffiti everywhere so that was really pretty and colourful. And now we're on the east side of Berlin,, next to the Spree, which I think is 'river' in German. And what's your first impression of Berlin? I really like it! It's very hipster, but it's like it's very cute and I feel very safe and, I don't know, I really appreciate it. And, like, all the artwork is really cool too. We have to try the food. We haven't tried the food yet. Yeah, we've been walking by so many restaurants and they all look pretty good and not too many of them are really expensive. Hi! It's day two in Berlin and we're outside the Brandenburg Gate. We're waiting for a free walking tour and we're going to see more of central Berlin. So, of course, we're going to take you along with us. Hey, Sophia! What have we been doing today? So, this morning we joined a Sandemans free walking tour, which was really interesting. We were brought around to the different monuments and memorials in Berlin and we got to know a bit more about the history. So I would recommend, if any of you are coming to Berlin, to check that out. It could be interesting. But right now we're just chilling in the park because the sun is shining. It's a beautiful day. There's a lot of greenery here, which is nice. So, yeah. I think this is the end of our travel video. I hope you enjoyed following us around Berlin and if you've been to Berlin, please comment below. Let us know where your favourite spots were or what you'd recommend to other people, and I hope you have a nice day! So that's goodbye from me and also Natasha! Bye! We're going to enjoy the sun. See you guys later. Bye!\n",
            "My name is Alejandra and I'm thirteen. How much is too much? In the morning, I'll go on my phone and I'll check my Instagram, Snapchat, Kik, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine. 78% of teens check their mobile devices at least hourly. I get more excited than I should get. Almost ¾ feel the need to immediately respond to messages. When I hear a buzz, I'm like, oh, I have friends. And 1 in 2 feel like they are addicted. I guess it would be addicting because you always have to be on it. 85% of parents feel their teens' device use has not harmed their relationship. My mom, she doesn't really have, like, rules, I guess. Yet 1 in 3 teens argue with their parents daily about it. I hope she thinks I have it under control because I think I do. What do you think?

            "I think technology, in general, has been worked in to everyone's day-to-day life. It is the first thing I do when I wake up, and when I go to bed. It's easy to just pick up your phone, turn it on. Call a ride, and just go wherever you want. New places to eat, new places to explore. It's great to stay in touch. I met my girlfriend on an online dating app, so I'd say that's a positive right there. Do you feel like you're in control of technology or is technology in control of you? Oof. Oh, it's definitely more in control of me. My biggest issue with it is knowing when to stop. Five and ten minutes here and there, and I feel like it takes up, you know, takes up a bunch of my day. I feel like it's in control of me, like, if my phone's dead for, like, half the day or something, and I'm going crazy. I think my math grade is the way it is because of my phone. Now I notice my eyes are, like, a little, like, I blink a little bit more, they get tired. He should just throw his phone away. Usually, I feel in control of technology. Usually. Usually, I can catch myself and be like, 'You need to chill out.' I think you have to set a limit, and say that you control the phone, it doesn't control you. I'd say most people hate on technology, but if you're using it for good things, I think it's really helpful. Well, we think it's important that they do have access to it and learn it. Technology is not so much as a necessary evil, it's a necessary good that could go either way. You know, the jury's out. It's up to us as to what we do with the technology.\n",
            "One of the things that attracted me most to Shakespeare as an actor to play with is he gives you an opportunity to play characters bigger than yourself. And being part of a process of making these very, very important and beautiful and touching and humane works of art come alive for people is obviously something that's very attractive to do. The worldwide appeal of Shakespeare I can't remember the first time I encountered Shakespeare. I do know I grew up in the same house as my grandfather and he quoted Shakespeare endlessly without me necessarily knowing. I think he quoted lots of different things. And I think in British culture that's how we encounter Shakespeare. You come across him without knowing it and slowly you realise where these things come from. But too often, I think people even in Britain feel that Shakespeare is something that belongs to other people, that it belongs to teachers, or it belongs to universities, or it belongs to upper-class people or it belongs to middle-class people. It really, really doesn't. Shakespeare belongs to everyone. He was writing for everyone. And there's a reason why Shakespeare's theatre was called The Globe. It wasn't just reflecting England. It wasn't just reflecting London or Britain. It was meant to represent everyone. His characters come from Italy, from Britain, they come from France, they come from Africa. Shakespeare is a truly international writer writing internationally. He may not have known a great deal about the world at the time he was writing but he was trying to speak for all of it. Shakespeare's plays often, a lot of his words, are put into a specific verse structure which we call the iambic pentameter. That sounds very complicated. It isn't. Iambic just means that it's got two beats in it that are ostensibly I Am. With the stress on the second part, I Am. But they are in a pentameter. That's a five-foot line. So in each line of the verse it goes I Am, I Am, I Am, I Am, I Am. Very simple. It's rather like any form of poetry or beat or song. But if you observe it, so for example, 'To be or not to be: that is the question.' If you observe the iambic the meaning becomes clearer. Obviously in speaking you don't say 'To be or not to be,' but the knowledge of that and by paying attention to that when you come to speak it the meaning becomes clearer. 'To be or not to be: that is the question.' You're leading to the final line. And when you say it and give yourself over to Shakespeare and you get out of the way, you stop trying to make sense of it and you stop trying to explain it to people, if you just give in to it, the line plays through you and sings and becomes clearer. All you actually need to do with Shakespeare is sit and just receive it. Just like when we watch films from America where, you know, you might be watching a sort of film about the police in some inner city in America. And everybody talks very quickly and you can't quite follow all the lingo but you don't worry. You just watch the scene. You'll find that you pick up quite a lot of it. Another interesting thing about Shakespeare is it's been argued that he often uses two words like 'pomp' and 'circumstance'. There's an expression from Shakespeare that's entered the English language. 'Pomp and circumstance', that's two words basically explaining the same thing with a very slight difference. And it's been argued that Shakespeare was writing not only for a heightened courtly audience, he was also writing for a more simple audience of journeymen and people... he was writing for everybody in Elizabethan society. So he also used quite common words. Words that were more easily understood and that way he made everybody understand. So I think even at Shakespeare's time, you know, he understood that not everybody was understanding everything at every given moment, but the general sense comes over you. We know that he it would appear that he invented a lot of words. It's debatable how many of the words he invented and how many of the words are just the first time we see them written down. But he obviously had confidence to be introducing new words to his audience because they were ready to try and understand.\n",
            "What is The Tempest really about? Well the plot of The Tempest on the face of it is quite simple. A group of people have been stranded on an island by a magician. But he's basically debating whether or not to take revenge on them and instead is learning that he needs to forgive and show mercy. But that's true of the other characters. Caliban feels wronged by Prospero. He wants to have Prospero killed. He wants to take the island back but he too needs to learn that actually forgiveness and mercy is the better road. We also get an opportunity to see Prospero as a parent, because for the Elizabethans of course a king was a kind of parent. So Prospero's daughter Miranda is important. But also too Caliban, who is in a way Prospero's son. We get to see how a bad parent produces a bad son. And we get to see that dynamic play out. So there's lots of different forms of interest, lots of different things that we can see. Playing Caliban in The Tempest Caliban is a very interesting part in that he's described by all the other characters in the play in so many different ways: he's a monster, he's a demi-devil, he's a fish, he's a moon-calf, he's deformed. A lot of these things are contradictory. How can he be a devil and a fish and a moon-calf and a deformed human? I think for an Elizabethan mind Caliban would have struck them as being a devil. As I say, he has all the vices: greed, wrath, lust. All the really bad things that people think drive them, Caliban has. But he's also kept human by Shakespeare. He doesn't have any magic. He clearly is in love with Miranda, desperately in love, but has been rejected by her and by Prospero. So his fury is coming from a place of love too. So that's how I started, was not wanting to rule anything out but try and keep everything in. So then you find a design that suits that and then you try also to do a realistic, naturalistic thing which is to imagine what it's like to be someone who was deserted on an island as a baby, his mother dies before Prospero finds him, and he's been left as a small child on an island surrounded by wild animals. There's a lot of complicated, interesting things you can do psychologically, you know, from research and through design. What is the best age to start seeing Shakespeare's plays? I have a ten-year-old son - in fact I have two sons, a ten- and a seven-year-old - and my ten-year-old has been coming and seeing Shakespeare since he was five. He saw All's Well That Ends Well when he was about five and a half and he's never been frightened of it, and he has now seen eight or so different Shakespeare plays, but because he was never told to worry about it he's always understood it. I find it extraordinary. He on his own learnt 'To be or not to be' one afternoon just because he wanted to. And that's thrilling. I have another son who's seven. He likes doing. He likes playing. He's not interested in sitting still and watching. And when he's come to the theatre he's been bored rigid. And I completely understand both attitudes. I hate being in the theatre and watching. I love being in the theatre and playing. But I'm delighted that one of my sons can listen to the language and not be frightened by it. So, you know, Shakespeare is not something that anyone should feel they have to like, or have to sit and watch. It's something you can come and go from.\n",
            "Good morning, Phil. Morning, Jo. Erm, what would you like to talk about today? Er, I thought I'd just say a little bit about the importance of, erm, trying to keep your body fit when you're getting older. I was, er, I had, my blood pressure was getting higher and the doctor was saying it was getting close to needing medication to improve it. And I said to him, 'I think I'd rather not have the medication but I will try and take more exercise.' So, I had to find some form of exercise which was enjoyable and which would also keep me fitter. So, I chose to take up playing tennis. I, erm, I'm quite good at hitting a ball or catching a ball so that wasn't any problem. And I get very bored if I just go running. But tennis has the advantage that you have a ball to chase around for an hour, you're stopping and starting, and it also has a very good social aspect to it where you join a club and you meet lots of other people who are, a lot of them are the same age as you, and you soon find some friends to play with. And you can go and play a game regularly, and then afterwards have a cup of coffee and a conversation with people. So, it gets you out of the house and meeting other people, and I think it has a whole lot of advantages. And it's certainly worked for me because I started playing regularly about eight or nine years ago and I have never needed to have any medication for my blood pressure. In fact, my blood pressure now is lower and more healthy than it was before I started playing. I really just got rather lazy. I used to take exercise and play, I used to play squash and other games when I was younger but then I got lazy. My knees got a bit creaky and I stopped playing anything until I took up tennis. And I think, really, it's transformed my life. I'm so much fitter than I was eight years ago. I feel healthier for it. I've made a lot of new friends who I have a lot of fun with. And I think it has tremendous benefits. Great! How old were you, may I ask, when you started playing tennis? I think I was in my early sixties. I was between about, I was probably about 63, between 60 and 65. And I'm now 72. And, erm, I have, my tennis in that time has improved a lot. I have a friend who is a retired tennis professional who I play with quite a lot, and he's given me quite a few tips on how to improve my tennis. And now I even occasionally get invited to play by some of the better players in the tennis club, which I think is rather good. It improves my morale as well as my fitness. Ah, that's great! Thank you very much. You're very welcome.\n",

You'd be getting close to wildlife, sleeping under the stars in a bush camp and flying over stunningly beautiful landscape in a hot air balloon. Your duties will include getting to know about aboriginal culture and eating traditional bushfoods, maybe including the famous witchetty grubs - insect larva. Like the idea of 200 days of sunshine every year? Job number two is a park ranger in tropical Queensland. It's a wonderful state with ancient rainforests, the world's largest sand island and the awesome Great Barrier Reef. Here your duties would include protecting and promoting native plants and animals, spectacular waterfalls, dinosaur fossils, untouched beaches and indigenous culture. You'd get paid to patrol the beaches of Lizard Island and live a life most people can only dream about. Another island job is as 'wildlife caretaker' on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. If you love all kinds of animals, this is the job for you. The advert says you'll be able to talk to wallabies, play with dolphins, cuddle koalas and sunbathe with seals on the unspoilt beach at Seal Bay. You would get about the island on foot, by bicycle, kayak or boat, taking photos and leaving only footprints. There is one potential drawback, though. You'd need to be pretty brave since you might come face to face with great white sharks. Maybe you are not quite so keen on the great outdoors and your talents are more journalistic. If you fancy feature writing, photography and making videos, you can apply for the position of lifestyle photojournalist for Time Out in Melbourne. You would be required to photograph and write about the city's coolest cafés and musical events. But you'd also cover tourist activities in the whole state of Victoria, including surfing on the Great Ocean Road, skiing at Mount Hotham or watching the little penguins at Phillip Island. Are you a foodie? Do you know about food, as well as love eating it? If the answer's yes, you can apply for the role of 'taste master' in Western Australia. Your job would be to promote the best restaurants, pubs, wineries and breweries. You'd also catch fresh seafood off the beautiful coast and learn all about making wine and beer. Finally, a fantastic job in Sydney. We've all seen those amazing firework displays in Sydney Harbour. Well, you could be one of the people making that happen next year. New South Wales is looking for a 'chief funster', who would be based in Sydney while travelling around the state and tweeting about the coolest things going on. This job would appeal to someone interested in everything: sports, the arts, entertainment, food. You'd also be involved in making the Sydney Festival, Mardi Gras and Vivid Festival as spectacular, and as fun, as possible.\n",
            "Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Hello. Now, have you ever noticed that when you log on to the internet, you nearly always see adverts for things that you're interested in? Yes? OK. So, let's say you were looking for a new pair of trainers last week. Well, suddenly you'll see adverts for trainers all over the place. Well, believe it or not, this isn't random. The internet browsers, websites and apps that we use know a lot about us because they monitor how we use their site or app. This way they can work out what we like and don't like. Clever! So, you've probably heard of cookies. Am I right? Yes? OK. When you visit some sites for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your computer that keeps a track on how you travel around the site and exactly what you do. So, the next time you use the site again, your computer will check the cookies and adapt, depending on the information it stored from your last visit. With me? OK. So, without even thinking about it, we give out a lot of information that can then be used to personalise our online experience. Now, I saw a great presentation last week by the internet activist Eli Pariser and I want to tell you a little bit about it. He wrote a book a few years ago called The Filter Bubble and I think it's something that we should all know about. Here's the book. We actually have it in the school library if you want to borrow it. In this talk I'm just going to give you a little taster. Now, he likens the 'filter bubble' to an ecosystem and he claims it is something that we should all be worried about. Now, after reading his book and watching his talk, I've got to say I agree with him. I think it's something you should all know about too. So, let me try to explain using a simple example. Imagine I support a political party so, to keep this really simple let's call it the Yellow Party. OK, so let's say I have lots of friends who also support the Yellows but some of my friends support the Reds. Now, on my favourite social media site I want to see the posts from all my friends but I tend to click more on the links that are posted by my friends who support the Yellows, like me, obviously. Even so, I do still want to see what the Reds are posting about. With me? OK. Now, a few months ago, just before the big elections I noticed something quite weird happening on my newsfeed. I noticed that my friends who support the Red Party had almost completely disappeared from the site, and I was only being shown posts from my Yellow friends. Weird. Now, I wondered if all my Red friends had left this social media space and moved somewhere else, but when I clicked on their profiles to check, I could see that they had been busy posting links and talking to people, but their posts were being hidden from me. And it's only now I understand why. I know it's because I hardly ever clicked on their posts and I didn't interact so much with them. So, the social media site itself had decided for me that I wasn't interested in their posts, so they decided not to show them to me. Now, this is an example of what Eli Pariser means by the filter bubble - it's when the websites and apps choose what information we can and can't see. Does that make sense?\n",
            "OK. So, moving on, if the social media sites can personalise the user experience, to block out things they think we don't want to see, well, begs the question, what else is being hidden from us? Well, in his talk Eli Pariser gives another example. Did you know that if two people type the same word into some of the most popular search engines, the results might be totally different? I know. Crazy, huh? Well, maybe you can try it one time with a friend. The example that Eli gave in his talk was two of his friends who have very different interests. They both typed the word 'Egypt' into a search engine. One got results from news websites about recent events in Egypt and the other got mainly travel guides. The results were totally different and this is because some search engines record information about what we usually look at, what we like and what our interests are. Some sites are now starting to personalise what an individual user sees. Now, sometimes, of course, it can be really helpful to have information personalised for us. It can save us time searching and often actually we do want to see the information that we're more interested in. It can make online shopping easier and it helps us to connect with like-minded people. But let's stop for a second and think. Do we really want the internet to offer us only what the internet thinks we want to see? Aren't we going to miss out on a lot of really interesting and fresh information? Well, whatever you think about the filter bubble, I think we all need to be aware that this is happening. By controlling the flow of information each individual receives, these algorithms mean we don't have access to all the information that is out there. So, aren't we missing out on a lot of really useful stuff? The question is, what can we do? Well, I have to say, I agree with Eli Pariser. I think we need to try and step outside of our filter bubbles from time to time to try and get our information from other sources, as well as the internet. And actually you can look for alternative search engines that don't filter the content in the same way. They exist too. There are also ways to depersonalise searches, but I will tell you more about that another day. For now, just try to make sure that you keep your eyes and ears open and learn as much as you can about how the internet actually works. Things change very quickly, but we should all try and keep up to date and learn more about how the wonderful worldwide web works. Thank you very much.\n",
            "For thousands of years the Maasai people in Kenya had no doubts about their relationship with the lions who shared the land with them. They were enemies. The lions wanted to kill the tribe's livestock and the Maasai had to protect the animals. It was even part of the coming-of-age ritual of young warriors to kill a lion. But now things have changed and the Maasai are part of a new East African scheme to protect lions, called the Lion Guardians. The aim is for local people to be trained to manage and protect the lions without involvement from outsiders after the period of initial training. The Lion Guardians are taught basic literacy, how to manage data, how to deal with conflict between humans and lions, GPS and telemetry tracking of radio-collared lions. Some of them also learn how to speak in public and how to blog. The Lion Guardians monitor the lions and other carnivores and inform cattle herders when to avoid the areas where there are lions. They also help improve the livestock enclosures and educate people about wildlife. Helping find lost livestock is another important job. In the past these would often have been killed by carnivores. If anyone is about to carry out a lion hunt, the Lion Guardians try and persuade them not to. Since many of the Guardians have killed lions in the past and are very experienced, they are highly respected in the community and are listened to by their age-mates, or peers, and often by their elders. They explain the importance of the lions to culture and tourism and how they can now be arrested for killing protected animals. One such Lion Guardian is Olubi Lairumbe. He has killed seven lions in his lifetime. The last one was a lioness who was pregnant with five cubs. He regretted killing her very much, had a massive change of heart and volunteered to become a Lion Guardian. Olubi's father used to hate lions and encouraged his sons to hunt them, but since Olubi became a Guardian, he has been advising them not to kill carnivores. Olubi was recently interviewed by Sir David Attenborough and appeared on the Africa documentary series. Another Guardian, Mingati Makarot, is very good at tracking lions using his traditional skills and has a great knowledge of the area that acts as a refuge to many wildlife species. Mingati is a past lion killer but has completely converted to being one of its ardent protectors. His name, Mingati, is a 'lion name' given to him meaning one who is fast and doesn't lag behind. In the past, a moran received a lion name after spearing a lion. In Maasai culture the name represents the characteristics of both the warrior and the lion he has killed. A warrior with a lion name feels that he has achieved something great. When the successful warrior brings the lion's mane and tail back to his manyatta to be put on display, he is treated as a hero. Other young men who don't yet have their lion names are called by the general name of 'moran'. They long to have recognition and dream about the day that it will be their turn to bring home the lion trophy. Now, this naming tradition is changing. The Lion Guardians experimented by giving lion names to boys who had not killed lions and it worked. Other young people called them by the lion names, then the older people did so too. There were still some boys who wanted to do something to prove their bravery, and they were assigned conservation tasks to do. Now young men can earn respect by protecting lions, rather than killing them. Another change is that the lions are now given Maasai names and each has a card explaining who the lion is related to and which lions they keep company with. Personalising the lions helps them to be seen as individuals by the community. Since the programme began in 2007, no lions have been killed in the area patrolled by Lion Guardians. Compare that to a similar neighbouring area without Guardians, where 63 have been killed, and you can see just how successful the scheme is. The Maasai have managed to successfully adapt their culture to changing times without giving up their identity.\n",

            "Hello. I'm going to talk about British festivals. I'm sure you've heard about the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Edinburgh Festival, but today we're going to look at a lot more that you might not know about. Actually, a lot of these are not exactly festivals, but strange races or competitions. Some of them are ancient and some are modern. So, let's start in January in the north of Scotland with the Burning of the Clavie. This is a whisky barrel which is set alight then carried through the streets as a bonfire. It's an ancient tradition which always takes place on 11th of January, the first day of the year, according to an older form of the calendar. The bonfire brings good luck for the coming year and people used to keep bits of burnt wood as protection against evil spirits. At the end of January, even further north, in the Shetland Islands, there's another fire festival, the Up Helly Aa. This seems like an ancient festival, but has actually only been going for about 130 years - well, it is fairly old, I suppose. People carry fire-lit torches and a Viking boat through the streets, then set fire to the boat. There's lots of dancing; it's good fun. Now to the north of England. On Shrove Tuesday in February, otherwise known as Pancake Day, a special Pancake Bell is rung in Scarborough. Everyone goes down to the road next to the beach where they skip - yep, they jump over long ropes, up to fifteen people to one rope. And they have pancake races. This is quite common in the UK - running with a frying pan and tossing a pancake at the same time. Another kind of race takes place in spring - cheese rolling. In Gloucestershire, in the south-west of England, round cheeses in round boxes are sent rolling down a hill and people run after them and try and catch them. The hill is very steep, so people often fall over - if you take part in this you need to be very fit and wear your oldest jeans. Nowadays this strange custom attracts visitors from all over the world, but the people from the local village are usually the ones who catch the cheese. From people-racing, to animals, very tiny animals. World Championship Snail Racing takes place in a village in Norfolk. The snails have to race from an inner circle to an outer circle and the winner gets a lot of lettuce. There's a party and barbecue for the snail owners and observers. This custom began in the 1960s after a local man saw something similar in France. In the UK we don't eat snails, by the way. More fun, in my opinion, are the onion-eating contest, also in Gloucestershire - a race to finish eating a raw onion - and the Black Pudding Throwing Championship, in Lancashire. Black puddings are like big sausages made mainly from dried blood. Contestants bowl three black puddings each at 21 Yorkshire puddings set on a six-metre platform; the winner is the one who knocks down the most. Another fun contest takes place in September at the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria in the north of England. The World Gurning Championship is a competition to pull the ugliest face. It sounds ridiculous but this is an ancient British tradition and the Crab Fair itself dates back to 1267. The man who won the title of best gurner the most in recent years had all his teeth taken out so he could make terrible faces more easily. Finally, let's go back to the south of England. In Brighton there's a Burning the Clocks Festival to celebrate the winter solstice on December 21st. This custom started twenty years ago and is very popular. People make clock lanterns and time-themed figures of paper and wood, then walk through the town to the beach where the sculptures are set on fire and there's a massive firework display. So, that's just a taste of a few of our old and more modern traditions. Would you like to take part in any of them?\n",
            "OK. Well, I want to talk about vinyl. Why? Well, I'm sat here, which you can't see, but I'm sat here holding a new record. Everyone's just laughed at me because I still buy vinyl records. Not very often, but if I can get them, I buy them. Everyone laughs 'cause, 'Oh, you've got CDs, we've got MP3s, we've got this, we've got that, we download. Why do you still buy vinyl?' Well, one reason is the sound. If you've got a good record player, nothing, but nothing, sounds as good as vinyl. MP3s have got this awful, tinny, strangulated sound where, kind of, the bass, the space is missing. So I'm kind of sat here, waving my vinyl record at the microphone. I'll have to wait a while to play it 'cause I don't have a record player. But there you go - when I hear it, it will be worth it. I've always bought records and I really like music. All my early records were in vinyl and one of the things that I like when I get them out the boxes at home is there's a thing there. There's a big picture, you can look at it, you open it out. You download something, it's, it's come and gone. I think for a lot of people now music isn't as special as it was, say, when I was younger, which was quite a long time ago. So, people in the 60s, in the 70s, in the 80s, music was just really special. You'd go to the shop and you'd have to save up to buy your records because they were quite expensive, so you didn't download hundreds and hundreds of tracks one after the other. You'd maybe buy, from school, we'd save dinner money or do little jobs. And then maybe once a month you could, kind of, go into town, find a good record shop - one that would let you listen to the records - you'd listen to two or three records in the shop, have a think, have a talk with the shop assistant and then you'd make your purchase. It was really exciting. You'd get this maybe I need to explain, because, for younger people, you got this big vinyl record which is about 12 inches across, so you had a big thing to look at, and when you got it home, open up, and there was bits inside it, pictures to look at, little bits of information on the cover, which were like little messages from another world. It was just really special, which I got lots of downloads, I've got CDs, but the music's still great but, they're not special any more. It's like they've just become it's just another product. I think, for most people, it's just another product.\n",
            "Welcome to the Voice Box, where we answer your questions and tell you all you need to know about everything voice-related. Can anyone learn to sing? Can anyone learn to sing? Erm, if you've got melody in your voice, like 'Can anyone learn to sing can anyone learn to sing can anyone learn to sing can anyone learn to sing ' it's basically if you can take the tone just a little bit higher than how you would speak, then that would be a starting point. The reason why a lot of people find it hard to sing is that they always kind of put themselves up against great singers, so they kind of feel 'If I can't sing like an Usher, a Chris Brown, an Adele, an Amy Winehouse, then I'm not even going to bother', but all singing is is basically being able to capture a melody above your normal speaking voice, and that's where you would actually start off. So, I would say yes, anyone can learn. Is there a way to stretch your vocal range? Thanks for your question, Jennifer. There is a way of, er, actually stretching your vocal cords. It's basically just by doing vocal scales. You know, if you were to do it every day starting from a comfortable position in your voice, you're doing 'La la la la la la la la la la la la la ' stretching it even higher 'da da da da da da da da da da da da da ' So basically, what you're doing, you're stretching your vocal cords, but it's important to make sure that you get the tension in your voice but not the strain. And in all the exercises that you do, it's imperative that you relax all your outer muscles. If you see when you look in the mirror you're straining and you see all the veins in your neck, or your shoulders - it's stiff, you've got to make sure before you tackle any exercise that you're nice and relaxed.\n",
            "Today we are going to talk about names, particularly fashions in names, you know, the kind of names famous people use for their children. You've been looking into this recently, haven't you Finn? I have indeed and it's a fascinating topic. The US leads here with new names and we in Britain follow sometimes, but we tend to go for the more traditional names. So, the big trend is using nouns as names. Nouns, what sort of nouns? Well they can be abstract qualities like Honor or Passion. There's a long tradition of this kind of name, like Faith or Charity, which used to be common names. A new name is Haven, that's growing in popularity. And similar names like Shelter, Harbor and Bay also convey feelings of safety and warmth. Mmm. I suppose Passion is used to mean 'extreme enthusiasm' nowadays, and people use the word a lot, so maybe it's a good choice for a modern name. Haven has a nice, safe feel to it. OK, then there are names which come from nature or animals, although with some of these it's hard to know whether they come from nature or a surname - that's another trend. Here we have Frost, Wolf, Fox, Bear, for boys, of course. And a new name: Ridge. Ridge, like a mountain ridge? The top of a mountain range? Yes, weird, huh? It's seen as a tough, outdoorsy name for a boy. OK, then there are musical names. Harmony and Melody have been around for ages, but Lyric is a new one. Lyric, wow! Yes, it came in at number 325 in the US a couple of years ago. That doesn't sound very popular, but there are so many different names being used at the moment that it means it isn't so unusual. Other noun categories are months - May, June and April are common, but January is uncommon and November very unusual. And then you have colours. Beyoncé and Jay-Z called their daughter Blue Ivy - a very distinctive name, a colour plus the name of a plant. Blue is very popular for girls right now, and Red or Grey for boys. I've just thought of another category. Food names, like Olive or Clementine. Yes, that's another one. Flower names are pretty common, but food names are unusual. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their daughter Apple, of course. Yes, poor child. Actually, Apple is becoming more and more popular, although people think that's because of the technology connection, not the fruit. New names always seem strange at first, but you quickly get used to them, like all the names from places or jobs. Chelsea and Brooklyn seem like normal names now; they were strange when they were first used. Taylor, Mason, Cooper are all first names from jobs. And they are also surnames, I think that's how they started. You're probably right there. What about the Beckhams' daughter, Harper? She was named after Harper Lee, the American novelist who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. That's another trend, naming children after famous writers, musicians - the British band One Direction have had an effect on names - or fictional characters, like Bella or Edward from the Twilight series, or Hermione from Harry Potter. Sorry, can I just interrupt there. I've just has a message passed on by the producer. A listener has just phoned in with a very strange story about a family in Holland with six children. Their names are all anagrams of the letters: A, E, L and X. Ah yes, I've heard about this. This family are famous in the world of bloggers on names. Let me see if I remember the names Alex and Axel and Lexa - they're the easy ones - Xela and Xael and the last one is Xeal - I'm guessing about the pronunciations, by the way. You mean there are names X-E-L-A and X-A-E-L? Yes, but they are very unusual. I think the Dutch family are stopping at six children, but there are about eighteen more possible anagrams they could use. Nooo, you're kidding! All seem horrible to me, but all are possible names. This is similar to another trend of giving children names all starting with the same letter, like the Kardashian family, all beginning with K, Kim, Kourtney and so on. The Kardashians have had enough publicity, let's not talk about them. What about your name? Finn, that sounds like a good Irish name\n",

Then I want you to write your answers in your notebook. Please be sincere! Nobody is going to look at your answers. When we complete the quiz I'll read out the results and you can think about them carefully for a few minutes in private. You need a pen and a blank page in your notebook. OK, pay attention, please. One. When do you usually get to school? a) Early, you like to have extra time 'just in case' something crops up. b) You always turn up just in time, as the bell rings. c) You often get to school late, out of breath from rushing. Two. When do you usually do your homework? a) As soon as you get it. The same evening. b) A day or two before you have to hand it in. c) The same day you hand it in. Sometimes it's late. Three. What is your average mark in tests? a) You usually do well and get seventy-five per cent or higher. b) You usually pass tests but your marks are near to fifty or sixty per cent. c) Your marks are often below fifty per cent. Four. What kind of a relationship do you have with the staff at school? a) Great! You get on well with most of the academic staff. b) Not bad. You have a good relationship with some members of staff. c) Dreadful. In general you don't get on with teachers. Five. Where do you usually sit in class? a) Usually at the front so you can see the board easily. b) Somewhere in the middle so you can daydream unnoticed. c) Near the back so you can turn on your mobile without being seen. Six. What do you want to do when you finish school? a) Carry on studying at university or college. b) You don't know yet. It depends on your exam results. c) Look for a job and start earning your own money. You'll be fed up with studying by then. OK. Now look at your answers and count the number of As, Bs and Cs. Then I'll read out the results. Are you ready? If you have mostly As, you are an exceptional student. You are mature and you have a superb attitude towards your studies. You definitely grasp the importance of a good education. If you have mostly Bs, you are an average student, but you are capable of much more and it isn't too late to improve and become an excellent student. You just need to make a few changes to your habits. If you have mostly Cs, you really need to adjust your outlook. You waste your time and you are at risk of finishing school without any qualifications. Think about your behaviour and consider making some changes before it's too late.\n",
            "'Metaverse' is the latest buzzword flying around the tech world. But what is it? Is it really the future? If we think of the internet as something that we look at, the metaverse is a virtual world, a version of the internet, that we are inside, controlling the experience. You can look however you want, talk to whoever you want, be wherever you want, appearing as an avatar. There are already examples of things you might think of being part of the metaverse. You may have seen avatars in video games and social media interacting inside digital worlds. Developers are working on new ways to get into the metaverse, using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses and even gloves that let you touch and feel virtual objects. And famous faces are jumping on to this new trend. You might have seen Ariana Grande or Justin Bieber's virtual concert.\n",

It's called the Statue of Unity and it was built to honour India's first deputy prime minister. This guy. It's made of iron and steel, cost around six million dollars to make, oh, and the most important stat: it's 183 metres tall. That's like 110 mes.

            "I'd like to thank you both for coming along today. Pam, this is your new book: Taking the blues out of work: How to deal with work-related health problems. Yes. And Steve, you've just recovered from work burnout, one of the most serious - and common - work-related problems, yes? Yes, that's right. I'm in the book! Pam used me as a case study. Yes. Steve came along to my clinic for help. He had a serious case of burnout. He followed a course of therapy and and she helped me to get my health back again. Well, that's great. It's good to hear there's a happy ending. Pam, could you tell us what work burnout actually is? Aren't we just talking about stress here? Is there a difference? Yes, there is a difference! A very big difference. But that's a good question because most people make the mistake of thinking that burnout is just another word for stress - so I'll start with that. Everyone understands stress. We live in a world where stress is part of our everyday lives. Burnout can be the result of too much stress, but it isn't the same thing. I once heard somebody say that if stress is like drowning in an overload of work, burnout is more like being all dried up. With stress we lose our energy, with burnout we lose much more - our motivation, our hope. And one very important difference between stress and burnout is that we know when we are stressed, but we don't usually realise we are suffering from burnout until it's too late. Exactly. Steve, how did you know that your problem was more serious than just being stressed? Well, I didn't realise myself. Other people realised first. I changed my behaviour and started feeling really negative and cynical about everything. That wasn't me at all. I've always been a happy-go-lucky sort of bloke. It got to the point where I felt so hopeless and depressed that I couldn't even face getting up in the morning. My wife made me an appointment with the doctor. He was helpful and referred me to Pam. Steve was lucky to have the support of his family and friends. It's difficult to get better on your own. It's important to do normal things - exercise, socialise, go for a walk, meet a friend for a coffee And did Steve need medication? No. We decided to try with everything else first. Medication can be effective - anti-depressants aren't the same these days as they used to be - but Steve got better without any. In fact, it was something he felt quite strongly about. I don't even like taking an aspirin unless I really have to, so I think I made a real effort to listen to Pam and do the things she suggested. I even started meditating! Meditating? Yes, it can really help. It calms the mind and helps to shut out the world's distractions. And how are you now, Steve? I feel great. Better than I have for years. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

Mekhatra, Feran and Naalah sat down to share how they feel about their hair. You can compliment it, yeah. No one can touch my hair. It's just off-limits. What does your hair mean to you? It's more of like an individuality type of thing, it's, like, what kind of separates me from about everyone else and what makes me unique to everyone, so people know when they see me, 'Oh wow, that, oh, that's my friend, yeah. He has really cool hair', or whatever. Has anyone said something about your hair that you didn't like? I was sitting on the carpet because it was carpet time, it was time to learn about something, and there was a girl behind me and she just started playing with my hair and my hair was in a bun so there was a big puff and she just kept on touching it, touching it and touching it. But, yeah, it was, it was uncomfortable. Well, as much as I know, no one can touch my hair, it's just off-limits. You can compliment it You can compliment it, say what you think, but... You can't touch! I am just so glad that, um, I'm seeing so many children, so many young boys, young girls, just embracing their textures, but everyone's hair is different, and everybody's hair is beautiful and it's unique. What do you want people to know about your hair? I like my hair the way it is, but either way, I'm gonna love my hair because that's who I am and that's just me. It may not be you, but that's how I feel about my hair. What I would like to say about my hair is that my hair is not some form of natural phenomenon. It's not hard to take care of and my hair is like everyone else's hair, just that it's more curly. And just because my hair is not the same as yours doesn't mean you can touch my hair or expect me to straighten my hair to match yours. Because everyone's hair is unique and everyone's hair requires different things to make it look nice. People should, like, know that black hair is hair and it's not weird. It's just, it's just something people are born with and something people should appreciate.\n",
            "The worst Christmas present I was ever given was a Tamagotchi which was twenty-four pets, all in one. So when one died you could just delete it and move on to the next one. So not a very good present at all. I was once given a travel hairdryer, which was bizarre because at the time I had really short hair and also very rarely travelled. So er... it failed on both counts. One Christmas I was given an alarm clock which was also a stationery pot, and as I opened it in front of the person that gave it to me it didn't turn on. Errr... which was really embarrassing. I threw it away, but now I know not to. I should recycle. I was once given a personal attack alarm which you could attach to your keys. However, when I would start my car engine, the alarm would fall off and start going off. Then I wouldn't be able to find it because it would fall underneath my car seat. So I would be in the car with the alarm going off. Not helpful!\n",
            "Hi Daniel, how are things? Have you applied for college yet? Well, I can't decide which one to go for. Lots of colleges have sent me their glossy brochures, and I see they now go on about how environmentally friendly they are. In fact, they've got a star rating system for this one. They're trying to attract as much interest as possible, though I'm not sure that would have much impact on my choice. Ultimately the course has to be the right one, though I can see they need to compete. Well, yes, but if I was torn between two courses, the new rating could decide it. It's good they're thinking about these issues, and the marketing people are certainly shouting about it. It's getting like the commercial sector, those companies who sponsor a charity for example, trying to persuade consumers that just by buying their products they're doing their bit for charity and can ignore other causes. I don't know if it increases sales, but the cynic in me reckons many companies just want to appear softer in the public eye, so they make a lot of noise about their charitable credentials.\n",
            "Are you still going to the gym, Frank? Yes, but not as often as I should be. That's the problem, isn't it? I've heard that the dropout rate among gym members is very high, even in those really expensive luxury health centers. Anyway, gyms aren't the answer. I'm sure the real key is to build exercise into your daily routine by doing something simple like walking to the mall, or taking the stairs, rather than the elevator, or doing sport. And another thing, people tend to think that a 60-minute workout entitles them to laze around for the rest of the day, or eat a lot and then undo all the good they might have done, but people who exercise little and often don't fall into the same trap. That's all very well, Mary. But what about the people who don't give up on the gym and who actually feel the benefit and quite enjoy the comradeship? Each to his own, you know. If you just give it another shot, you might find it suited you too.\n",
            "What did you study at university, Alicia? Horticulture, plants and things. I was based at a regional one, but I also spent time studying in the capital. Seems a strange place to go if you want to grow things the middle of a huge city. That's what my fellow students said. I mean, I know it wasn't ideal. It's a harsh climate, winters are bitterly cold and the summer's sweltering with little rain. But folks in the city are just determined to grow stuff on rooftops, balconies, wherever. They'll just garden anywhere they can. It was a reminder of the strong spirit of gardeners. Come to think of it, I do remember noticing the way some of the trees were looked after there. Instead of bare bits of ground around urban trees, they seem to take great pride in filling the earth around them with flowers. And all that's done by the residents themselves. It's as if every tree is to be celebrated. I wouldn't go that far. Not all parts of the city are like that.\n",
            "Hi everyone, my name's Josh Brady and recently I was lucky enough to go on a botany trip to South Africa with my tutor and other students from my university to gather data for the research project we'd been involved in all year. I didn't post my diary or blog on the university website because I'd promised to submit a report on my return which would appear there and I was working on that from day one. We were going to explore a beautiful region of coastal countryside that had previously been affected not by drought, as is common on some parts of the African continent I've studied, but by fire. We wanted to see how the flora and other life forms there had recovered. In fact, some plants growing there are dependent on this kind of event to trigger their germination. When we first saw the landscape, however, we felt rather confused. Much of the area seemed to be cultivated fields, principally of red tea rather than the colourful flowers we'd been led to expect. Sensing our confusion, our tutor reassured us that we'd soon be off to a wilder area where we'd see a more striking range of specimens. We'd imagined this would involve being taken around in a kind of minibus or even a van and trailer, but in fact what we boarded was what I can only describe as a safari truck and we headed out into the natural vegetation. When we arrived and started walking through the vegetation, I found the shape of the leaves rather a surprise. Coastal plants can often be tough, with leaves coming to a point like sharp knives, but these resembled needles more than anything else. That meant I was inadequately dressed for walking through them in thin trousers. I was also totally unprepared for the amazing scent that the plants gave off. By the end of that trip, I'd lost count of how many species we'd come across. Small, delicate pink specimens, bright yellow heathers, one with deep orange blooms the mental image of which will stay with me forever, and bright crimson wild specimens. The local farmers are totally committed to protecting the flowers and plants that have colonised the area. Conservationists call it shrubland, in other words a vast area of vegetation that now has a rich array of plant species, but that sounds a bit negative for a place that to me seemed like a paradise. One drawback was that, although the bedrooms in our hostel each had a balcony, the view was of the backyard with a small garden beyond, which was hardly impressive. But by way of compensation, the roof offered a spectacular vantage point over the surrounding scenery. We spent every evening watching the sun go down from there, a magical end to each fantastic day. Anyway, the trip was the most amazing night of our life.\n",
            "Today we're looking at careers in journalism. My guests are Jenny Langdon and Peter Sharples, both regular columnists on major publications. Jenny, you made your name really young, didn't you? Relatively, yes. I was a raw recruit on the local paper when a scandal broke concerning a celebrity living nearby. Out of the blue, I found myself with a scoop on my hands. Basically, I found the guy, interviewed him, then hid him someplace where reporters on rival papers wouldn't find him. When the story broke next day, the editorial team had actually coupled the front page story together from my notes, but it was attributed to me by name. Before I knew what was happening, I'd been headhunted by a National Daily. It was a turning point, alright, but I can hardly claim it as a shrewd career move or anything. And the editor at that National Daily was a notoriously bad-tempered individual. Well, there's no denying he deserved that reputation. I mean, having landed a dream job, I was really thrown in at the deep end. My desk was right outside his office, so I was first in the firing line if anything went wrong. Even stuff I'd had no hand in. But I knew better than to argue and was thick-skinned enough not to take it personally. Anyway, that's what the paper was like, always on the edge, and I really flourished in that environment. Eventually getting your own Daily column. And that's where I really came into my own. I mean, I'd done stints on the sports desk, been celebrity correspondent, the works. Actually, I only got offered the column as a stock gap when my predecessor left under a cloud. But I was desperate to hold onto it, and it came at just the right time. If it had been earlier, I'd never have had the nerve or the experience to make it my own. Let's bring Peter in here. You started off on the celebrity magazine called Carp, didn't you? I did, ostensibly thanks to a speculative letter to the editor when I was still a student. Actually, I'd been doing stuff for a student newspaper all through university. Skills I learnt there stood me in good stead. When Carp magazine called me for interview, my approach to college news convinced them I was in touch with reality. You know, budgets, deadlines, all that. That's what swung it in my favour. It wasn't just having my finger on the pulse as far as youth culture was concerned, important as that was at Carp. Can I ask you both whether you'd say courses in journalism are worth doing? Jenny? Well, I wanted to write, and a journalism course seemed a reasonable enough starting point. Journalism is at least paid up front, unlike some forms of writing, and there's no denying that was an incentive. So, yes, I did one, and you know, if I hadn't, who knows if I'd have been able to handle the stuff thrown at me when I first arrived at the newspaper. It does give you that grounding, but I wouldn't say it taught me everything I needed. Fortunately, a stint on the student newspaper filled in the gaps. As is so often the case, they're often criticised for taking too strong a line on issues, but they're invaluable because they give you that free rein, and you're generally writing from the heart rather than for the money. I'd say, by all means, do a course, theorise all you like in the classroom, but just bear in mind that it's no substitute for getting out there, for developing your own style. Now you've both recently published novels, is this a change of direction? People keep asking that. I like to think that, much as I rate myself as a journalist, and feel I have nothing left to prove, I'm still up for the next thing that comes along. I'll never be a prize-winning novelist, but having a go at it keeps me on my toes. It would be easy enough to get stale doing a column like mine, but that does remain my grand passion. I don't know about you, Peter, but I'm hardly thinking of moving on. Well, I expect there's people who'd say we should stand aside to give up-and-coming writers a chance, but no, I'm not. I'd go along with the idea of diversification, keeping you nimble, though, and I'm not making great claims for my novel either, but I would take issue with the idea that journalism itself holds no further challenge. I wish I had your confidence, Jenny. I'm always telling myself that I'm only as good as my last piece and there's no room for complacency. And there we must leave it. Thank you both.\n",
            "After college I worked in a bank to make money. It's a great job if you like sitting at the same desk every day surrounded by the same familiar faces. I got plenty of annual leave and the work itself was quite demanding but one day I woke up and realised that it didn't amount to much and was really pretty pointless. Handing in my notice was the next logical step. I set up as a freelance photographer, a job I'd always dreamed of. After the first six months or so of sheer panic I'd feel much calmer. This will always be a risky job but ultimately a far more rewarding one. Not financially, mind you. The family car sales business was the obvious and safe career route for me even though we didn't always see eye to eye. I'd no complaints about the money but that didn't stop me looking at what other people were doing and thinking now that's something I'd really like to get my teeth into. And that's how I got into rally driving really. I went to rally school part time then got signed up by a rally team. That's when I left the motor business. Not without a bit of soul searching. I miss the family but looking at myself now, travelling the world, maybe even having the chance to make millions living on the edge, what's not to love? I've always worked in the music industry but was never made to feel very welcome in the marketing department. I guess my face didn't fit although I was doing well enough. Then by chance I heard a band playing in my local venue and thought they were great. I got them signed up and suddenly realised this was exactly the type of work that suited me and my abilities. Searching for talent, giving kids a start in the business I loved. So after a while I left the company to do just that on a freelance basis. Pay's not bad, it's possible to negotiate good percentages but that's not why I do it. I worked in a busy studio as a radio copywriter. It was challenging and fun but frustrating because it wasn't leading anywhere career wise. I was spotted by one of the radio executives, he liked my way with words and gave me the chance of a presenting slot on a general interest show. I jumped at it but underestimated the skills involved. Without training it's proving a steep learning curve. It would have been better to work as an intern for free for a while to learn the ropes but it's all about seizing the moment. Too good an opportunity to miss. Now I've got a foot in the door I'm pretty optimistic about making a go of it. I had a responsible job that I'd worked hard for. Most people would consider being an eye surgeon pretty rewarding both financially and emotionally. I wasn't keen to leave but the long shifts and the sheer volume of patients got me down. I wanted to use my knowledge and experience in other ways. I did some research on the effects of sunlight on children's eyes and eventually started up my own business. We manufacture a range of sunglasses designed to protect children's eyes against harmful rays. I'm my own boss so I call the shots which suits me down to the ground. I have to be strict with myself about taking holidays though.\n",
            "So, how did your work experience placement turn out? Well, all I can say is I'm glad it's over and it's a relief to be back at college. I worked for a friend of my dad's. One thing I've learned is listen to advice, because I think I should have gone to a company with a recognised work experience programme. At Blooms they were friendly enough, but didn't quite know what to do with me, how to treat me. There was nothing set up, so I generally ended up filing. I mean, it's a mindless task. I didn't mind that, but it's hardly the sort of thing to give someone an overview of what's available job-wise in an office. I suppose you mixed with business tycoons and have come back with big ideas. Well, not exactly, though there were things I did learn and I feel I know a bit more about what to expect. I spent time in several departments. I can see myself going in for finance, eventually, but not for a while yet. There seemed so many constraints. I was amazed by the dress code, for instance. Here at college I'm glad to be back on familiar ground. Having said that, now what about that coursework assignment?\n",
            "There's too much fuss over wetlands. They're only boggy, rather sad, wet areas visited by geeks and birdwatchers, but few others. I know nature buffs get excited over them, but aren't they mostly useless places? I read they only take up less than 1% of the Earth's surface anyway. Excepted, they're visually stunning. There's something about a watery landscape that seems to speak to something deep in the human psyche, but spending vast amounts of money to preserve them for ducks... Wetlands are certainly good for ducks, but what about people? Sun plus water equals life, but we manage that equation very badly. When it rains, we seem bent on getting rid of the stuff, swishing it out to sea. But wetlands hold water and release it slowly. I'm not even going into their fish stocks or their role in flood control. You'd think we'd hang on to them. Instead, they're being degraded faster than other ecosystems. But put water back, birds zoom in, the land recovers virtually in front of your eyes. It's such a pity people are unaware that reversing the damage can be so straightforward. And the beauty you mentioned, that goes without saying.\n",
            "Is this a picture of your family on a camping holiday, Sarah? Yeah. I came across it recently when I was clearing out the cupboards. That's me in the centre. It was my fourth birthday, I think. I love it. It's just a fragment in time, isn't it? Shot almost by accident. But it's much more intriguing than any carefully set up photo could be. Mmm. There's your parents and, uncles and aunts in the background? Yeah, all smiling. You'd never imagine they didn't get on, would you? Anyway, I didn't notice at first, but now I do recognise much of the stuff that followed us around on camping holidays. The battered saucepan, the old flask that's now in my garage gathering dust because I can't bear to part with it. I guess every family has its own collection of familiar objects like that. The flotsam of life. Yeah, but now I see them as old friends. And that's got me looking around my house in a different way. Imagining my young son feeling like that. Looking fondly on our stuff as mementos of our shared lives together.\n",
            "Hello everyone, my name's Jack Byers. I'm here today to tell you about the project I worked on during my vacation, which was linked to my university studies. Okay, let me backtrack a bit. I'm currently doing a degree in chemical engineering. I've always wondered how we'll solve problems such as sustainable energy and in particular climate change, which I think was really the key factor in influencing my choice of degree subject. After graduation, I could go on to find a job in areas such as pharmaceuticals, the mobile phone industry, or even in the oil industry. At the moment though, the last of those seems less appealing because I'm very committed to nature conservation. I somehow feel there might be a conflict of interest there. Anyway, I'm looking forward to being able to make a contribution to the responsible processing of raw materials, and I'm not just talking about fossil fuels here. That would be great. However, the work I do might also have negative effects on the environment, and that brings me neatly on to my project on the beach. My tutor advised me to join a relevant project during the summer vacation to gain experience I'd need after I graduated, so I decided I'd apply to help clean up some beaches near where I live to get some first-hand experience of the devastating effects of litter on coastal ecosystems. And some of the biggest polluters, I discovered, are particles of plastic that end up in our seas. They can be found washed up on beaches all over the world, but are often assumed to be small stones. These pellets of plastic, sometimes called nurdles, enter the marine environment in factory waste. Most of the nurdles we collected were white, and the whiter they are, the newer they are. They soon start to yellow, and the brown ones have generally been in the sea for many years, whereas black ones are likely to contain tar, so that's not such a secure indication of age. But the fact remains that these things don't break down or decompose in any way, and sea creatures end up eating these with their food with dire consequences. This really brought home to me the need for more ecologically friendly plastic materials, rather than what are referred to as single-use plastics, such as supermarket carrier bags and wrappers, which should be phased out of production. I have to say, too, that I wasn't prepared for the amount of other rubbish I found on the beach. Some of it wasn't that unusual, like the cartons and drink cans left behind, but I also came across a large chunk off a surfboard, and I did start to wonder what the backstory was there. While I was working on the beach, I was lucky enough to meet a conservationist called Martin, who told me all about the various rocks and shells on the beach, before getting me to look closely at the seaweed. It was all over the sand, and of course, very interesting from a chemical engineering point of view. Then we investigated some rock pools, where we came across a number of small animals. So, before I go on to talk about the sea, I want to thank you for your support.\n",
            "As part of our series on jobs connected with sport, we have two sports psychologists, Tessa Payne and Ryan Moss, with us today. Firstly, you work mainly with runners, don't you, Tessa? How can sports psychology help runners? I introduce a number of what I call meditation strategies. This allows runners to clear their minds and visualize how they want to run, smoothly without pushing too hard initially. In this way, they're prepared and a lot of problems are ironed out. Just like in job interviews, being prepared for the questions is less stressful than being unprepared. These tools enable you to be in the moment rather than letting your mind wander into irrelevant areas. Now, Ryan, you work across a wide range of sports and age groups. What are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their potential in sport? Let's start with kids. Some coaches and well-meaning parents are unaware of the effect they have. From them comes the obsession with coming first, which actually burns kids out and turns them off just when they should be getting started. There are over 35 million kids aged 6 to 15 participating in sports in the U.S., yet by the age of 16, over 75% of them have dropped out. Most have just stopped competing because this focus on achievement means it's no longer fun. On the other hand, a positive attitude from a coach or a parent can be really infectious. There's a lot of emphasis today on creating what are known as elite high school sports programs. What's your view on this, Ryan? Well, on paper they look fantastic. More high schools are starting to compete for prestigious awards and are likely to continue to do so. That's great for the winners, of course. And the coaches earn a name for themselves if their teams make the grade, which I suspect is what motivates some. But do they care about the future development of the kids and whether or not they continue to be involved after high school? What they fail to take on board is the idea that a team flourishes as a whole. Every athlete has a contribution to make, and that includes those that haven't a hope of getting on the medals boards. They learn from each other, in my view. As a runner yourself, Tessa, what important lessons have you learned? Actually, running's taught me a lot. It teaches you to become something other than ordinary. It also teaches you accountability, that is, to do the right thing, which is something that's missing today. And running teaches you to see your competitors as partners. They help you to push yourself further than you would have done without them, so you sometimes end up in a position you'd only dreamed of. That's why I believe in sincerely thanking other runners after the race. You've just written a book entitled, Sports Psychology for All. What message did you want to convey? It's my first book, and I wasn't sure initially what angle to take. You know, a number of books focus on how to motivate yourself when things aren't going well with training. That's certainly something sports psychology can help with. I felt, though, that there were plenty of manuals out there about that. I talked to some colleagues about investigating the no-gain-without-pain idea, which is so familiar now, you know, the notion that an athlete who goes through the pain barrier will come out stronger. I wanted to investigate when that idea actually originated in different cultures and how it developed, but people thought that angle would be too obscure, so I dismissed it initially. The idea wouldn't go away, though, so a condensed version of it to suit athletes with limited time is what I eventually put together. Focusing on getting the most out of the daily workout is an interesting issue, too, certainly a topic I'd like to explore at some point. Now, a question for both of you. What's the essence of a true champion? Well, I think champions have to do their best to position themselves for personal and, crucially, also for team victory, too. The author Ray Bradbury used the image of standing on a high cliff and having to decide whether to walk away or to jump. Of course, he doesn't mean this literally. Champions need a hundred percent commitment. There's no half measures. There's no denying that. If you back away, you get nothing, but if you step off, you might actually fly. That works for sports, too. It's often said that any decent athlete can become a champion by putting in the necessary time and effort to prepare properly for their event. I'm sure hard work leads to huge progress, though being a star is on another plane, in my view. Yes, I'd go along with that. Tessa, Ryan, there we must leave it. Thank you very much for appearing today.\n",
            "To be honest, poetry's never really been my thing, you know, but my girlfriend, she was pretty keen. But not to go on her own, because she's just so shy about meeting new people. The teacher was just brilliant, as everyone was saying. He had this really, like, neat way of explaining some really hard ideas. And the poems were about all sorts. Not just soppy love and that, but modern things too. Yeah, teenage issues, relevant stuff and that. And you'll never guess what happened. After only a couple of weeks, he had me, yeah, me, producing my own poems. Honest! It was just, well, fantastic. Having recently moved here, I was keen to attend the City Guided Walks course, because to be honest, I didn't have the first idea about the place, and I wanted to get the whole story, right from the beginning. It turned out to be a real tour de force, an action-packed gallop through local history, in the places events happened. But there was a strange mix of fellow students. One or two of them, well, I couldn't see why they bothered coming, frankly. Always moaning about how exhausted they were, the high fees, and why couldn't we just look at the usual tourist stuff? They'd have been better off staying home watching TV. For anyone who has a passion for music, and wants to expand their musical horizons, I'd certainly recommend this course. I can read music, and I've been a pretty good violinist for ages, but always fancy trying the guitar, not really taking it up, just having a go. Abi, the friendly, enthusiastic tutor, put us all at ease. We were a varied bunch, young and old, male and female, with assorted backgrounds, abilities and experience, but she managed it effortlessly. The totally unexpected icing on the cake? Well, one thing has led to another, and we all got to play alongside professional musicians, some of whom have even invited me to play with them elsewhere. A basic psychology course sounded likely to be a dull affair, but my brother recommended this one, and the reality was very different. Much of it, as he'd promised, was directly relevant to workplace human resources issues, and you need to know this stuff nowadays to get on, which is why I was there. The tutor was superb, if unconventional. We had to act out scenes from childhood and discuss holiday disasters, once even sing a song. Bizarre. But it all worked a treat. It's certainly given me confidence for other things I might have to do in the future. Plenty of food for thought, too. Might try the advanced level next year. Languages aren't really my thing, you know, but the Spanish course was rather enjoyable. Everything was very relaxed, and socialising outside class was encouraged, so I made several new friends. But what topped it for me, and I really hadn't been expecting it, were the local Spanish restaurants the tutor occasionally used as a setting for his otherwise pretty standard lessons. Going there really broke down barriers and got us using the language. Plus, great food and friendly service, though obviously a bit pricey. What's more, my Spanish friends really impressed. She now accepts that she underestimated me, which was my aim all along.\n",
            "Good morning everyone and welcome. Thanks for coming. My name is Jane Watson and I look forward to meeting you all personally. Some of you are here just for today, others, I know, will be attending for all three days. I'm just going to say a few words on behalf of my company who have organised this event, Global Conferences plc. As you know today's seminar is The Business Master Class to be conducted by our distinguished guest who I will introduce in a moment. But first a few quick points of organisation which perhaps you'd like to note. All the sessions will take place in this hotel except for the last session on Tomorrow's Software, which will be at the New City Hotel. We will meet there at 2pm and this will give us a chance to see in action some of the things we have been discussing. A map with directions to the New City Hotel is available from me if you wish to make your own way. Alternatively there will be a bus going there at 1.30pm. There is limited car parking at the New City Hotel so if you wish to drive there you will need a permit. You can get one from the conference office. Now to the reason we are all here. We are very fortunate to have a seminar today led by Dr Martin Sangalli, one of the most prominent and well-respected commentators in the world business community. He has been asked to advise many large corporations. He is a specialist in the strategic use of information technology in banking, pharmaceuticals and retail. He has his own company called Logic Solutions which consults with some of the biggest names in the world of business. He is also an adviser to Intertel and a non-executive director of Global Conferences. Thousands of business and technology managers have benefited from reading his best-selling book, Intelligent Change. Always inspiring and thought-provoking, his ideas have helped hundreds of organisations to gain a glimpse of the future. He is Europe's most famous IT Analyst. Dr Sangalli - welcome. Thank you Jane for that flattering introduction. I hope I can live up to it. So to begin. There are two main difficulties facing all corporations today. Firstly, how to make themselves more customer-driven. Secondly, and as a result of that, is the question of how to go about the major task of developing and implementing new organisational structures. This is a senior management session and is designed to provide you with two things. I hope that by the end of the session you will be equipped to design your own framework for action. To help you do this you will also be able to take away documentation of real-life case studies that I have been involved in. So, if you would like to look at the screen\n",
            "Of course, I was looking forward to it. I mean, it meant seeing the results of quite a lengthy process to find the right person, which I myself had invested quite a lot of time in. It's a demanding post, with a lot of responsibility. I think the potential we thought we'd spotted is being realised, and that she's going to deliver the sort of new initiatives we hoped for. She's already got the team adapting to her approach. But I did feel a bit stupid in the meeting, sitting there without the right figures. I just can't believe I didn't pick up the chart. I could still see it, sitting on my desk. Well, the whole thing was a serious challenge, and if I'm honest I didn't really feel up to it in the first place. It wasn't a good time to be going away from the office, and I certainly didn't feel happy, being asked to present pretty different ideas at this stage of the game. I completely understand that the last thing they wanted was to have someone dropping in from above, as it were, and saying, oh, well, we've decided to change the rules, etcetera. They'd been applying the system as it was in good faith. And then I was just so tired. What with the wedding celebration going on in the hotel, I definitely didn't get enough rest, and that left me disorientated and so I under performed. I wasn't happy to be going out there when there was so much that had to be dealt with, just left there on my desk. My secretary's extremely good, but she can't do the impossible, obviously. But it was clearly crucial to get some kind of idea of what it looked like, whether we were on to the right kind of thing. Getting the right location and space is vital. I'm more or less convinced that this is right for what we want. It will attract customers. The trouble is, I had out-of-date architect's plans with me, so I kept getting confused about the dimensions. But the hotel staff were really helpful when we were trying to get the up-to-date stuff faxed through. It's the first time I've been over there since we decided to go ahead with the expansion and I must say I was impressed with the number of really good candidates there were. It really is a good region, in terms of being able to attract and recruit the right people and I'm confident we chose the right people. I wish the same thing was true for the other branches. What I just can't believe is that I managed to set such a bad example by arriving a whole hour after we should have started. I felt like a real fool, going on about heavy traffic, when I'd never accept that kind of excuse myself! They said it was all different, and they certainly weren't wrong! I could hardly believe some of it! It's definitely eye-opening to see what policy can mean in reality. But the way they're applying it, I mean the actual techniques, really is impressive. I didn't say anything, of course, just took my notes, and I will be drawing up my report as soon as I can. I'll definitely be recommending that some of their ways of going about things get applied in the other branches. It was confusing at the same time, I have to admit. They were showing me all these graphs, different models of analysis, and I couldn't really follow that way of presenting the data. And then that guy's accent! Great hotel, though.\n",
            "Good morning, nice to meet you. Do sit down. Thank you. Now you're Human Resources Manager of Jenkins, aren't you? Give me some background on the company - so I get a general picture. Stephen Jenkins founded the company nearly thirty years ago, and named it after himself, and he ran it for a long time. Last year one of our competitors proposed combining, with the idea that separately the two companies were too small to survive. They were probably right, but anyway Stephen turned down the offer. Then, because he was getting on, he handed over the day-to-day running to his daughter, Catherine, while retaining full control himself. And you make children's clothes, don't you? Aren't there problems in the sector? Well, we mostly sell to retail chains, which sell them under their own brand labels. Things aren't as easy as they were, what with cheap imports, and the more expensive children's boutiques making inroads at the top end of the market. But we position ourselves in the middle range, so we're not too badly affected. We're under increasing pressure to cut our profit margins, though, because of growing competition between high street retailers. What would you say is the company's strength? It certainly helps that we supply those large retailers I mentioned, and in fact some of them have been customers for years. I suppose, though, that we wouldn't have survived this long if it wasn't that we don't send anything out unless it meets very exacting standards. Our customers appreciate that, plus the fact that we aim to keep the time from order to delivery very short, and they're prepared to pay a premium for it. What about weaknesses? Well, we've got a poor record in providing training on the machines we're currently using. And I have to say that Stephen used to run the company in a very old-fashioned, autocratic way, which alienated a lot of the workers. Despite Catherine's more enlightened approach, it's an uphill struggle to try to change attitudes and improve co-operation. Never an easy task! No. You mentioned on the phone that there's a problem with a particular group of workers. Yes, there's very high turnover among the machinists, that's the people who actually make the clothes. They say they're faced with unreasonable demands all the time, like having to learn to operate several machines instead of just one or two. Many of them think they could get an easier job for the money, because there are plenty of other jobs on offer locally. The reasonably healthy state of our order books gives them a certain amount of job security, but they just don't seem to care. How's their work organised? We've changed to a 'sectionalised flow' approach, which means the machinists work in teams. Rather than each machinist being assigned a complete item of clothing, the work is divided into batches involving various operations, each of them undertaken by one machinist. As that person finishes, the work is passed on to the machinist responsible for the next stage. Has that had any impact on what you produce? Yes, it's enabled Catherine to introduce a policy of rapid diversification of the product range, so the number of itemised clothes has leapt. That's the total number of different styles, in all the different sizes. And that's reduced batch sizes: long runs on an item are a thing of the past. At least half the styles used to be carried through from one year to the next, but now only a quarter are, so as you can see, it's had quite an impact on the rate of change. What's the effect on the machinists? That policy was part of a raft of changes, one of which is that the machinists are now paid on a piecework basis, rather than at an hourly rate. They're furious about that, though to be fair, the rate that's paid for learning to use a new machine has been calculated so as to make sure that no-one loses out in the short term. And they're also aggrieved because so much is new, and far more batches of work fail quality inspections and have to be redone. Now tell me something about training\n",
            "OK. Now last time we looked at the ways in which companies are making improvements in their supply chain, to reduce the cost of raw materials, and to get them to the factory as cheaply and efficiently as possible. Ironically, though, there can be a downside to this. All too often, better supply chains simply transform raw materials faster into goods that people don't want to buy. In fact, there is now a massive problem of almost all products being in oversupply, and the headache for manufacturers is that technologically there's little to choose between the offerings. Often the only point of differentiation between competing manufacturers lies in their advertising spend, and that may be the only means of persuading consumers to buy your products rather than a rival's. The result is marketing overkill. In order to make sales in an overcrowded market, companies bombard consumers with a multiplicity of messages, with ever smaller effect on consumers. And paradoxically, perhaps, amidst all this choice there are clear indications that, by and large, satisfaction is plunging among consumers. Cynicism rules, customers are overstimulated by the incessant advertising, and they are increasingly unpredictable in their reactions to advertising and in what they choose to purchase. As a result, companies remain as ignorant as ever about customers. Many businesses are serious about customer relationship marketing, investing heavily in databases to keep track of their customers. Yet even though this means they're drowning in data, little of it can be put to good effect, both because of the volatility among consumers, and because the software doesn't track customer response in real time. By using traditional one-way media such as posters or the press, firms don't know if a marketing campaign has been successful until long after the event. But with 'closed-loop marketing', the response of targeted consumers can be continuously monitored, and the campaign adjusted at any time. Closed-loop marketing employs electronic media, such as the internet, call centres, mobile phones and at point of sale, allowing companies to engage in a dialogue with consumers, using bite-sized chunks of information that can be tested one by one. Let me give you an example. Global Beach, a company which specialises in closed-loop marketing, designed a campaign for a luxury car manufacturer, to persuade potential buyers to take a test drive. Using a database of people who had registered an interest on a website, Global Beach tested and refined a range of incentives. It found, for example, that people were most responsive if they were e-mailed mid-morning proposing a lunchtime test-drive with a complimentary meal at a nearby café. The result for the client, Jaguar, was a 16 per cent conversion rate from registering an interest to taking a test drive, compared with 1 per cent or less for traditional methods. For companies, closed-loop marketing gives the opportunity to minimise the waste that was previously built into marketing budgets. As well as the benefits I've briefly suggested, it can inform strategic decisions, by providing information about how to segment markets, identify market opportunities, plan campaigns, and evaluate results. Once closed-loop marketing becomes the norm, consumers will have far fewer junk e-mails to contend with, and may even be able to choose which companies they'll allow to target them.\n",
            "It's a mixed picture, I think. There's plenty of new blood, with all the new people we've taken on, many of them fresh out of business school, but nobody's potential is really being fully exploited in any of the various departments. Part of the problem is that our computer network is being built up piecemeal, in a series of knee-jerk responses to demands from individuals. We need a proper far-sighted strategy to sort it out and provide a decent level of efficiency. But yes, there are some grounds for optimism elsewhere, with what seems to be a new approach to the management of information. Standardising the procedures for keeping records to be passed up to line managers for approval will help in co-ordinating activity and budgets. Yes, we have to make money work for us, although I don't think we're going far enough, even with the proposed change. It's true that with so many managers going to more and more destinations, spending has escalated and needs to be checked carefully: cost should be related to result, and waste and extravagance should be eliminated. So, yes, it's high time new limits were set like this. However, there are other areas we'll need to trim before we can realise our potential, and people is the biggest. But we're blocked by the MD's overly strong sense of loyalty to the managers, when it may be time to lose some of them and give the newer recruits a chance, especially those with diplomas in computing. If we stay this top-heavy, we'll never grow. Little by little, I suppose we're getting there. I'm certainly pleased to see they're looking at enabling the employees to retrieve relevant data from the web themselves, so everyone in marketing will be able to research other companies' sites directly - and it's something most people already have the training to do, so it's just a question of some basic networking, which shouldn't cost the earth. Having said that, there's still a long way to go to solve all our system issues and get the company really growing. It seems a shame that we produce such excellent goods, but then have clients frustrated by frequent delays or breakages in transit. I'd've thought there must be other firms we could think of using who could handle despatches properly. If we are to increase our competitiveness and grow our market share, there'll have to be more radical changes than are being looked at now. We need to take a good hard look at how staff are deployed. There seems to be a deep resistance to facing the problems caused by a lack of integration, the way IT's so isolated from production, for example: I'm surprised there aren't serious issues of quality control as a result. But yes, I accept that the proposed system of responsibilities will help to some degree. Distributing responsibilities among existing deputy department heads and new people appointed to the post of senior supervisor will increase effectiveness, although we'll have to see whether this will operate within the current reporting set-up or not. I think the need for change here is at a very fundamental level, and that all that's being considered at present is really only at surface level. Being in the IT sector, we do tend to think in terms of systems and connections, but ultimately it's the people factor that will guarantee us increased success. It's the people with responsibility at departmental level that concern me - they see highly-qualified newcomers entering and settling in, but they don't see adequate support for themselves. It's creating resentment, and damaging morale with long-term consequences. For the short-term, I think leaving the training as it is makes sense, and I do endorse the changes they want to make to staff evaluation, making it far more comprehensive by building in more relevant factors. A good move.\n",
            "Hi Kelly. Oh, hi Daniel. I've been thinking about the viability of various types of packaging for our new line of products. Any definite ideas yet? Well, I've been reading about consumer attitudes to packaging. A lot of companies think people's chief preferences nowadays are how easy-to-use containers are,easy-pour necks, re-sealable caps and so on. It's also considered that environmental issues shape the way consumers perceive products, depending on the materials used. To me, the crucial point about packaging is that consumers think manufacturers are using it merely to convey product information. They don't feel manufacturers are attempting to influence them to buy the product through the package. And therein lies the real advantage for us. If we get it right, it'll help us turn over huge sales of the new range. Interesting. It sounds a pretty daunting challenge to come up with a pack type that'll do that. We really need an imaginative solution, don't we? And we don't want to overstretch the budget either, I do think, whatever we go for, the test will be to persuade our target market that there's a credible justification for choosing that particular packaging type. I'm not sure how we incorporate that into market trials though. Hm, needs thought. I've been pondering how we could use the information we include on packages to greater advantage. Yes, Well, we spell out the product benefits on the front of the package and list the main ingredients that people want to know. But there's 90-100 words on the back that are important advertising space, a vehicle for talking to the customer. We should be using that to establish a real dialogue and collect useful feedback. Customers don't want to read about their statutory rights and what to do if they're not satisfied. There'd be no harm in drafting some text. I see packaging as the most important marketing tool at our disposal. It may be that, for consumers, it's the only means of differentiation in a market where, let's face it, so many contenders are alike. Whereas the truth is - for people in our line of work - packaging is an incredibly potent force. It can bring whole sectors into existence allowing products and brands to evolve. Exactly. Of course you know the Australian drinks company, Smile. Oh yeah,. Well, they've undergone a complete rebranding exercise and switched to using foil pouches for their range of children's drinks, at a time when their main rivals were selling their brands in plastic bottles. Smile were very clever: by opting for a pack type that's largely unfamiliar for their category of product, it actually led consumers to reappraise the brand. By adopting the meaning of other product categories, they were able to underline important qualities, like freshness. Traditional packaging is taken for granted by consumers, so it wouldn't have been an effective way for Smile to advertise that they'd switched to using organic produce and added vitamins to their drinks. A real marketing coup. They're seeing exponential growth since their new packages hit supermarket shelves. I've a feeling that what's really sparked this success is that they've capitalised on consumers' concerns for healthier products. I have to say what I like is the humorous character their design team came up with for the packaging, and the light-hearted approach they put across. I saw a lot of Smile products when I was in Australia. It's awe-inspiring how they offer a rare glimpse into the philosophy of the people who make the product. There's a real social dimension that comes across. Prior to that, Smile had expanded into all kinds of drinks, including the children's market, which left the brand in danger of getting overstretched. Well, I have one reservation about their new packs. I know doing away with the transparent windows on their cartons gave them space to incorporate more text. But they've used too many different styles in the graphics that don't look compatible with each other. But at least redesigning the packaging gave them the chance to sort out the weakness with the caps and incorporate an easy-pour spout. Mm. Anyway, let's talk about what we,\n",
            "Today we're looking at the darker side of literature with two books about not-so-happy families. And we've got writer Helen Slade and book critic Anna Kimura to talk us through them. First up, we're looking at Her Mother's Daughter by Alice Fitzgerald, a novel written from two points of view, one of a child and the other of her very troubled mother. Helen, I have to be honest. I found this one hard to read. It's very well written but, well, how did you find it? I know what you mean, but I literally couldn't put it down and stayed up till three in the morning to finish it. There's something about immersing yourself in a family this flawed, this damaged, that's compelling. You'd never want to be in that family yourself, but that's what reading is about, isn't it? Wearing someone else's shoes for a while without ever having to live their reality. You surprise me! The families in your own books are a million miles away from this one. Yeah, my readers can always be sure they're going to get a happy ending. Which you definitely... I don't want to give too much away here, but you definitely don't feel like a happy ending is coming for these characters. OK, so don't mention the ending, but can you just describe for listeners what the book is about? So, it's about a family with secrets. The mother has hidden her troubled childhood from her husband and her two children but, of course, it's shaped her entire personality and how she behaves as a mother and as a wife. Which is especially obvious when we're reading the sections told in the child's voice, even though the little girl herself doesn't understand the meaning of everything she's seeing. For me, what was really so shocking was less what happened to the mother when she was a child but how the mother treated her own children. Why is that, do you think? I think we're all programmed to see mothers as something sacred and pure. As a child she was mistreated by her father, and in some ways we're not that shocked by that, which is a sad thing in itself, and her own mother didn't help her. As a reader we're less affected by that, I think, because that part of the story is revealed to us in the mother's voice, the adult voice. But the reason the way she treats her own child is so much more shocking is that the child is telling us about it and we sympathise with her. It's very clever how the author plays on our natural instincts to protect a child. Though we do feel sorry for the mother too. Or, at least, I did. It's hard not to. She's trapped in her own unhappiness. And we're trapped right there with her as the reader. It made me wonder, Anna, why is it that miserable books like this one sell so well? Because all of us have families. I suppose the books play out things we all see in much smaller ways in our own family lives. The other hard-hitting book this week is We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver. Now there's a family who have a problem! They definitely do. Very few people will ever have a killer as a teenage son like the narrator in the book, but we can all identify with the challenges and often terrifying reality of raising teenagers! So can you give us the lowdown on Kevin, then, Anna? This book is written from the point of view of the mother in letters she's writing to her husband, Kevin's father. Again, we shouldn't say too much about the ending, but the way the author uses the letters is very clever. I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It's a difficult topic, but it was much easier to read than Her Mother's Daughter. As Helen said before, it's about the voice of the narrator. There's no child's voice and, in this story, the victims in many ways are the adults, though, of course, Kevin's sister is a victim of her brother's evil. Yes, and the idea of where 'evil' comes from is a theme that comes out in both books. If you choose to call it 'evil' that is. I prefer to describe it as a complete lack of empathy. The mother in Her Mother's Daughter had a terrible childhood, but Kevin's from a happy home and good parents. Is he though? The mother often admits she found motherhood hard. Aren't we supposed to think she might have caused Kevin to turn out the way he does? Just like in Her Mother's Daughter. Both books certainly look at how the mistakes of the parents affect children. And this is another reason we relate to these books. Parents are always worrying if they're doing a good job.\n",
            "This is Ariana back in 2006 performing in the school production of the musical Calamity Jane. And I'm here to get all the goss about Ari's schooldays from her former teacher, Candi Tandy. That was so good! Her voice was just perfect from way back then. Yes. Now, Candi, Ariana was in your choir and you taught her one-on-one. Tell me everything and do not hold back. One of the things I remember the most about her in class-time was that she just she couldn't sit still, like, she had to be doing something, kind of like the class clown. So what's your favourite story about Ariana? She had received the Music Student of the Month award and most of the time when the kids would get their award, they would just stand there with their certificate and smile. But not her. She decided that she wanted to do something really zany, so out of her pocket she pulls, like, a shower cap. And she puts that on her head and she makes this interesting pose and she says, 'Can I do this?' It was so adorable and so unique that I said, 'Absolutely, let's do it.' And that was her picture. And we have some of the yearbooks. I love looking at old photos of people. Oh, there she is. Oh, she's so cute! She had a little fringe on the side back then. Being a star pupil and winning a music award at school gets you three Ambo points, Miss Grande. Whilst at the school, I decided to catch up with some current pupils who are hoping to follow in Ariana's footsteps. Daniel, how do you feel to be going to the same school as her? It feels really good. And knowing also that we do the same thing that she did when she was in school too. Is that what you want to do when you're older? Well, performing is one of my favourite things to do and to, like, follow what she did is, like, really cool. So are you super proud of her? Yes. Yeah, definitely. Aww. What's your favourite Ariana Grande song? 'Break Free'. 'Break Free'! Same here! Guys, I feel this!\n",
            "Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview. It's my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me. Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We're creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company. Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you're looking for. That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you've been doing over the past four years or so. Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&D, to corporate clients. OK, so it was only B2B? Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C. Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago. Yes, that's right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development. I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now? Well, I very much like the L&D side of my role and I've always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I'm looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right? Yes, that's right. Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&D. I'm also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values. Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&D qualification. Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management. Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we're looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company? I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won't be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role. Yes, that would be a good thing. Also, I'm used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale. I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me? Um, I think we've covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though. Go on. Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis? Well, there's the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There's usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also. OK. Thanks. That's all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like? That's a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven't devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy. Thank you. That sounds interesting. Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We'll be discussing all candidates next week and then I'll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome. Thank you for your time. I'd welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.\n",
            "Thanks, everyone, for coming to this project meeting. I know we're all working cross-functionally on this project, but so far the key stakeholders are really pleased with how it's going. This project will really benefit our overall value proposition and the company as a whole. Thanks, John. It's an important project. It's good to be collaborating on this together. Yes, it's important, but we're all so busy with our regular jobs. It'll be difficult to fit things in. It's OK, Matteo. We'll work it out. I know that you all have a lot on at the moment, combining this project with your regular jobs. So, what do we need to do, and by when? Good questions, Barbara. We have a number of key deliverables to discuss so it's essential we're all in agreement about roles and responsibilities and also the timelines we're working to. Great. Yes, it's good to get this clear. So, the first thing we need to do is design the customer survey questionnaire. In my experience, this is best done through an online survey tool. That sounds like a great idea. I'm glad you have experience with this. Yeah, we've done something similar on previous projects. So will you do that, John? I'd love to but I'm already tied up managing this project, and my line manager, Kate, has agreed that I should focus on the timelines, reporting and financial management. I'd like Akiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn't you? Yeah, happy to take it on. Thanks, Akiko. Next thing is we need the new designs finalised. Matteo, you said you could do this in a couple of weeks, right? Yeah, I know, but that was last month, and then nothing happened. I'm overloaded at the moment and my line manager won't be happy if I don't hit my targets. Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority. Hmm. I see. I can understand the challenge you're facing. I've been in that situation before. So, what can we do to help you hit those targets and free up some time? That's a good question. If I could get a slight reduction in my targets, I could use the extra time that would create to finish the designs for this project. OK. We might not be able to get your targets reduced, but I'll see what we can do. How about if I support Matteo there? I know his job well and I have some capacity at the moment. I can help him meet his targets so he can free up some time to finish the designs for this project. Could you, Barbara? Hmm. I'm not sure if it's fair to ask Barbara to be supporting Matteo in his regular job so he can work on this project. It's up to you, but I'm happy to support Matteo with his regular work, just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He's the only one with the expertise. Yeah, you're right. OK, thanks a lot, Barbara. I appreciate it. Matteo, would that work for you? Yes, that would work. Thanks. OK, you've made it easy for me to say yes. OK, then that's settled. Thanks, both. I really appreciate your help in this. So, can you get them done by the end of the month? Yes, that should be no problem.C1_a_project_management_meeting\n",
            "The big four-oh, Charles! Oh!! It's your 40th! Are you planning a party? Nah, I never celebrate birthdays. I don't see why this one should be any different. Why not? First, you know me, I can't be bothered with the hassle. It's my birthday but I'm supposed to do all the hard work - contacting people, finding a venue, organising food, worrying who will show up. No, thanks. Ah, someone's angling for a surprise party, eh, Dora? Marco, stop! Even worse. Having to pretend to be delighted 50 people just sprang up in your living room when you thought you were coming home to put your feet up. Probably having a heart attack at the shock. Note to self, never to organise you a surprise party. OK then! You've got to do something, though, Charles. It's your 40th. Why? What's so great about getting old? Er still being here to have your birthday? Yeah, 'Ageing is better than the alternative', as they say. Yeah, and it's true - so why not celebrate? You guys can have parties for your 40ths if you like. I just don't go in for that kind of self-indulgent attention-seeking. Wow, that's a bit harsh! I had a huge bash for my 30th. And you came. And enjoyed yourself if I recall. Are you trying to say I was just doing it for attention? Not exactly but well at least a small part of you must have been. Remind me not to invite you to my 40th then, so you won't have to put up with my huge ego while I feed you and provide free drinks all night because I thought we were friends. I meant, er, I mean, not all attention-seeking is bad. It's just not my style is all. Whereas it is mine? Anyway... I didn't say that! Er, yes, yes, you did. You said celebrating birthdays is self-indulgent and... Guys, guys! Who knew birthdays was such a touchy subject? Speaking of which, I have to sort out my nine-year-old's party the weekend after next. Now, that's a party I'd love to organise. Really? It's a nightmare. It's not like when we were kids. Now you have to take them all rock-climbing or hire a make-up artist to come and teach them how to look like a zombie or a film star. And there'd be trouble if someone else in school had the same kind of party and your kid gets accused of copying. That fear you said about no one turning up? It's a million times worse when you're scared your kid is going to have no one turn up. Is there that much pressure? Yeah, it's crazy. Last year, I got it right with a cinema trip. Simple, but always a winner. But we can't do the same thing again apparently. It says it in my 'Official Laws for 9-Year-Olds' book. That's a pity. I've got so many fond memories of birthday parties as a kid. Party food and games and watching cartoons until your parents arrived. Trust me, your parents were stressing out! At the risk of restarting the argument, when do you think you stopped enjoying birthdays then? I dunno really somewhere around moving away from home and getting a job and being a grown-up. I don't mean birthdays are immature. I mean, it takes a while to make new friends and so birthdays just become more low-key and it's drinks with a couple of friends or dinner or something. And I just got out of the habit, I guess. Maybe I just need to have a kids-style party like we used to have! Play musical chairs and eat pineapple and cheese on sticks and all that. Very retro. I bet people would love that. Yeah, they would. Well, I would anyway. And maybe it'll catch on with my kids and it'll start a new party trend. You've got me thinking it's not a terrible idea. Maybe I will have a party this year!\n",
            "Careful, careful... Rob, don't drop it! Well, if you shout at me I will! Put it down there... there to the left, the left a bit! Oh, all right, the right. Oh, can I just put it down!?

Can't even keep a job as a banana! Get off! Very silky! Get off! Or I'll clout you with my banana! All right, all right! Let's watch some telly.\n",
            "I'll never forget the day on the beach. After that first run, I think we did a run at 60 mile an hour, just to get the feel of how everything was going to go and that then and that then I knew, whoa, this ain't right. This is going to go wrong. What is it? Three mile of beach and you look at that and well, it's straight enough, straight enough and you are stood there looking, straight enough but when you are going around a slight curve, but when you're going round all slight curves at over 100 mile an hour, eh, yeah they're not slight curves... they're... Yeah, it took every bit just for me to be able to stay in behind the truck and I had to stay. If I had dropped off the side of the truck, I was going to get the wind blast and it was going to take me off. So it just... and for me the biggest thing, like, I'm used to riding usually on tarmac and the tarmac's a constant, it's... it's solid so the bike gives a bit, the tyres deflect, the wheels deflect, the frame deflects a bit so you get the feeling through the bike... but because we were doing it on the beach it was all the deflection was taking place on the sand and it was just giving this really alien feel on the bike, really alien. It just felt horrible, felt horrible, horrible. Can I tell the speed that we did? I know it, I know exactly. We did 112.94 mile an hour. It scarred me for life I think, that moment when I were doing 112.94 on my pushbike. The whole thing, the skin of my teeth! All, all the variants we had on that day, that was as fast as we could have gone. But I still think we've got unfinished business, I think... Could you go any more? Yeah! I now, I've got it set in my mind. I don't know how I'm going to do it. I want to do 200 mile an hour on a pushbike, I want to do 200 mile on a pushbike. I'm not saying that is not going to be easy, it's not going to be easy. You know we need to make a few changes to the bike, a few bits and bobs. It's all, it's all possible. I just need to get you boys talked into it! Yeah, yeah!\n",
            "Camila Cabello, our guest this morning. And I've got to talk to you about something that we've I can't believe we've waited until now to talk about this. Because when you were at the Grammys Yes. you were part of something which was, like, I feel, like, 'steal', like the 'steal' of the night, like, the moment of the night at the Grammys, which was: you were on stage and you were, you were presenting? Yeah, I was presenting. You were presenting and in the crowd was, you know, every famous person in the world. So you've got, like, Beyoncé and Jay-Z and in the middle, Blue Ivy. Blue Ivy. And of course, the next day the headlines were: 'Blue Ivy is doing a weird “shush-y” thing to her mum and dad'. Do you remember? What do you think that means? I don't know. I was I was I had a moment of just insecurity. I surprised myself. Uh huh. I was like, 'What does that mean?' I literally went into the I was like, I'm not going to go into this wormhole of, like, 'Do you think that she didn't like my speech?' or 'Do you?', like, what do you think? I don't know. I think I literally stopped. I was like, 'You know what? I'm not going to think about that.' Right. We can't think about what Blue Ivy's No. Because I feel like, she would like me. Yeah. I think she'd like you. I took it as Kids like me! 'I'm a favourite with kids, right? So, she likes me!' I think what she was doing was was, like, she was over the applause interrupting your speech. Are you lying? No! I do. You really think that? I think she was saying to, like, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, to her mum and dad, like, 'She's not finished. She's still talking.' So I think she was like, 'Be cool. Be cool.' Aww. Jay-Z's face in that, by the way, is my favourite face of the year. I didn't really study that as long as I, you know, as I should have. Please re-watch. Please re-watch. Because he is like, 'What are you doing?' No way! Yeah! It's real he's like, 'Uh!' No way! Oh my God. That's so cute! That's so adorable. No, I was I thank God that I didn't look down at the crowd while that was happening. Because that would have Yeah, 'She's shushing me!' No! Just no, no, no, no. Just seeing them there. Actually, just seeing people there. Uh-huh. I would have just been like, 'Wow!' Yeah, you can't The good thing is I had just come off off of Kesha's performance. Uh-huh. So I was like I didn't have time to be to think about it. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And, you know what's crazy? The day before the Grammys, I had to make this emergency trip to the eye doctor. Right. Because I can't see Now, oh my God, now I'm thinking about the Brits because I'm presenting at the Brits! Yes. And I can't see from far away. So you can't read the thing. So I can't read the prompters. And so my Grammys thing was long and I couldn't memorise it. And also, memorising it is terrifying. Yeah, that's too scary. It's terrifying. It's TV and everyone fails. So I had to go to the eye doctor and get glasses made and I had to put on my glasses. I like the glasses. But it was with my cute outfit. Yeah! So now I'm going to have to put on my glasses with the Brits and I'm wearing this pretty dress. Like, come on, Grimmy! I think you can do it. You can wear those glasses. I think you just get them out and be like, 'These are my reading glasses.' If I eat, like, ten bowls of carrots Uh-huh. Do think it'll is it too late? I think if we do ten today, twelve tomorrow, sixteen on Wednesday Do you think my eyes will be you will be able to read it. You've got this.\n",
            "One of the things that a lot of people comment on is that dogs seem to be naturally attuned to them and be able to sense their moods and whatever. Part of our work here is actually to look into the scientific basis of that. The key to a dog's ability to read our emotions might lie in something we all do without knowing it. When we express our emotions in our faces we don't do it symmetrically. It's been shown that if you take somebody's face when they're expressing some emotion, like happiness or anger or something like that, there is a difference between the left and right side. Composite faces consisting of two right or two left sides look very different. One of the theories is that maybe our emotions are more faithfully presented in the right side of our face and that's the side that we tune into. And when we look at a face, we have what's known as a natural left-gaze bias. So you naturally look much more towards the left, i.e. the right-hand side of somebody's face. Eye-tracking software has demonstrated that when presented with a human face, we nearly always look left first. Daniel Mills wanted to find out if dogs use the same trick to read human faces. Shifting the direction of your gaze we thought was fairly unique to people until we started looking at dogs. To test the theory, his team recreated this experiment with dogs. Muz, what's that? They presented a series of images showing human faces, dog faces and inanimate objects, and recorded the direction of the dog's gaze with a video camera. We found that dogs when they are looking at pictures of dog faces or objects, they will look randomly on the left or the right. But when it came to human faces, they made a remarkable discovery. So now we have Taz looking at a human face. So first she's looking in the middle of the screen. And here is the first eye movement on the left. She's in the middle and she's going on the left. And then the dog is going to be even more on the left. So now this is Muz, and then we can see really well that this is a left gaze. From here to here, we can see the white here. She's even moving her head. As far as we know, no other animal has this relationship with the human face. Dogs don't do this with each other. Incredibly, it seems they've acquired a new skill to enable them to read our emotions. Being able to detect when somebody is angry or potentially going to be harmful to them, you could understand that there may be a biological advantage in being able to read people's emotions. And equally, it makes sense for a dog to approach somebody when they're smiling. If dogs can read human emotion, and increasingly the scientific evidence is beginning to point in that direction, that's going to form the basis of a very strong bond between human and dog. Evidence like this appears to underpin our conviction that dogs understand us in a way that other animals cannot.\n",
            "Jean, hi! Hi, Dave. How are you? Good, good. Wait a second, I'm not calling you in Canada, right? You're back now, aren't you? Yeah, I got back two days ago. Oh good, phew. Because I wouldn't want to be calling you long distance without realising it and suddenly... You've spent a fortune on a long-distance call. No, I know, it's OK. I actually wouldn't answer the phone while I was over there if I saw the call was coming from England. But no worries, we're in the same country now. Yeah. So, how was the trip? Did you meet your long-lost uncle? I did, actually. It was very good. I flew to Toronto and stayed there for a few days. At first I was really worried about my accommodation because I kept reading these appalling stories about rental flats going all wrong. Oh, was it one of those? Yeah. My friend had a disastrous experience in Barcelona with one of them. The place didn't look anything like the photos, and all the neighbours hated that there was a holiday flat in their building. Awkward situation. Urgh. Right. So, as I was saying, I was really worried because I heard these stories. And at first I couldn't find the place. Turns out I was in the wrong building. It was next door, and on the top floor, and wow. Jean, this place was fabulous! Really spacious, with these floor-to-ceiling windows and the most scenic views of the city. I could see the lake and the whole city skyline and skyscrapers from my bedroom. I had to pinch myself to prove I wasn't dreaming. Sounds pretty cool. So, what's it like? The city, I mean. I've always wanted to go to Canada. It's nice. I mean, it's another big, vibrant, modern city. But it's really clean, and there's lots of parks. One of the things I liked was the multiculturalism. We visited Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown, Little India umm, I can't remember the others but it was sort of a new area every three or four blocks, you know? Hey, is it true that there's a whole part of the city that's underground? I read that somewhere about Toronto, or saw it on some TV show. It's true! I asked about that. They call it the PATH. There's, like, almost 30 kilometres of restaurants, shops, cinemas and stuff all underground. In the middle of the downtown area. Amazing! Yeah, but actually once you're down there it's not that noticeable. There's actually a lot of natural light. I forgot we were underground. It's mostly useful to get out of the cold weather. What temperature was it while you were there? It was still only November, but it was getting cold. We had at least a day where it was less than zero. My uncle told me that in January and February it can go down to 20 below zero. Oh, wow. I think I'd die! Yeah, and the worst thing was what they call the 'wind-chill' factor. So they say the temperature is zero degrees, but minus eight with the wind chill. So it feels like minus eight. And my uncle said the wind-chill factor can go down to minus 40. Stop it! You're making me feel cold just thinking about it. So, how was meeting your uncle? The famous Uncle George. That was great too. He lives outside of Toronto, in a cottage by a lake. Really tranquil and unspoiled nature. I'm dying to see photos. You want to meet up soon? Or are you too jet lagged still? Yeah, I'm actually free tomorrow if you like.\n",
            "I'll never forget the first time I met our new contact from Retrolink, one of our top five customers. I had travelled to their office to meet him in person, talk about the history of our companies together and define a shared vision for future co-operation. I wanted to focus on building a good relationship with him which would be a good foundation for working together. So, when we met I wanted to make a good impression and also show him respect. I greeted him with a handshake and addressed him by his surname. When I put my hand out I realised he had been moving in to give me a hug, so we did an awkward mixture of the two! Also, when I greeted him by his surname, he responded politely, though he used my first name. It was all a little uncomfortable. In this situation, I guess I made assumptions about the level of formality he expected. Even though he had never met me before, he knew our two companies had been doing business with each other for years and he wanted to build on that history by being less formal with me from the beginning. The real learning here for me was that I shouldn't assume we all have the same ideas about meeting people for the first time. I'd never worked with a virtual team on an international project before. It was quite exciting, though also challenging to work with people from different countries, many of whom I would never actually get to meet in person. There were a lot of things that were different about working in the same office and it was quite challenging at the beginning. For example, there were different time zones, different IT systems and even different local regulations, which impacted on what each person was allowed to, or able to, do for the project. There were also interpersonal differences, such as different ways of working, approaches to deadlines and when to reply to emails. And we shouldn't forget the fact that English was the project language and that most people on the team had to work in a language which wasn't their first. A positive of this was that it meant that everyone, including the native English speakers, had to make the effort to communicate clearly and clarify their own and everyone else's understanding. To help us all get on the same page, we defined the communication norms and the rules the team would follow, as well as the meeting dates and deadlines. We laid this all out in a document called a team or project charter. This was really useful and in the end the project was a great success. I'm looking forward to working on my next international project. I went through a bit of a rough patch last year at work. I was already committed to too much and then we lost a team member through restructuring and I quickly became overloaded. This led to me doing too much overtime and feeling very stressed. My boss was really helpful and she pushed back against the unrealistic targets that had been set for our department. She also introduced me to the smart approach to goal setting. It's an acronym, S-M-A-R-T. You use it to create goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. I used this approach to deal with all of the things that were overloading me. It helped me to prioritise some tasks, to do some later and to drop some completely. I often use this approach now and feel much more in control of my time and workload. Have you ever missed a flight or had one cancelled? I did. It happened to me last week. My flight home from a business trip was the last one of the day and we were told it was going to be delayed. That's always a risk at the end of each day. The ground crew kept extending the delay until eventually they cancelled the flight completely. They then told us to go back through the airport to the departures area to talk to their agent who would organise hotels for everyone and rebook us on the following day's flight. As soon as they made the announcement about the cancellation, I knew I had to think quickly as it would not be likely that the flight would have capacity to take everyone from my cancelled flight. I hurried back through the airport and was one of the first to make it to the desk. That turned out to be a good idea, as there were only nine seats available on the flight the next morning. Everyone else had to fly to a different airport and then continue back to our destination airport in coaches. Lucky me! Right?\n",
            "Everyone thinks my life is a piece of cake. They think my life's a beach. Just because I get good grades they think I have it easy. It could be worse, at least I'm not Craig. Everyone else in this place belongs somewhere. If you're a Jock, an Emo or a girlie girl then you find that others like you and you stick together. I don't fit in anywhere. This morning, Stephano and Trinculo: the role of the clowns in Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. Sorry I'm late, Miss. Oh, Craig, Right on cue. Everyone calls Craig the class clown, but not in a good way. This place is like a circus, but Craig's not the clown. Chloe Davies! Daydreaming is not permitted. Did you get your results this morning? Yeah. I heard the shouting. Dad was just encouraging me. He shouldn't treat you like that. It's not really any of your business. Craig's not a clown, he's a puppet. His dad pulls the strings. This morning, Shakespeare's genius: juggling comedy and tragedy. Ah, Craig! Craig, catch it! Thanks. For what? For what you said yesterday. My dad shouldn't treat me like that. So I went home and told him. How did he take it? Not very well. See you later. Craig. Yeah? Can you teach me how to do that? Sure, no problem. Bye. Everybody thinks my life is a piece of cake. They think my life's a beach. It's not. My life's a juggling act.\n",
            "Britain is a creative nation... Art, music, gaming and film-making - you'll find it all here. But why is it that Great Britain has more creative people, per head of population, than anywhere else in the world? Let's find out This is the London Film Museum. Here you'll find original costumes and props from some of the world's greatest films. This museum has it all. Iconic monsters, robots, fantasy and so much more... Ahhh - one of my boyhood heroes, Batman. Jonathan Sands founded and created the museum, and over half of the collection is from his own private archive. Jonathan, I'm a huge fan of movies so I'm very excited to be here. What's the idea behind the London Film Museum? The Film Museum primarily promotes the British film industry through a number of mediums, including original artefacts and costumes and sets. A lot of our friends, who we've accumulated over the years, have donated material to the museum and it is the only film museum like it in the UK. And how did it come about? Well, it came about because originally we ourselves are from the film industry. We owned a prop company, a prop being an artefact or an item that is used on the film, many of which you'll see here. Why do you think it is that Britain leads the world when it comes to film-making? I think primarily for two reasons. One, we have fantastic facilities, like the Pinewoods, Sheppertons and soon to be the Leavesdens, and we also have the best and the most creative talent, whether it's in front of camera or behind the camera, really. From creativity on the small screen to creativity on the big stage the UK has a thriving theatrical tradition. London's West End is the largest theatrical district in the world. And it's not only happening in London. Great Britain hosts one of the world's largest cultural events - this is the Edinburgh Festival. The Festival takes place each year in August and attracts acts and visitors from around the world.\n",
            "Another side of British culture that attracts tourists is the range of visual arts on show. There are over 300 world-class museums and art galleries just in London. This is Tate Britain - right here, in Millbank. It's the home of British art from the 1500s right up to the present day - let's go take a look. Tate Britain is the world centre for British art. Some of the greatest artists of all time are British and this gallery has them all under one roof. Tate Britain is one of four Tate galleries across the country, and the oldest. Over the years, it's been threatened by bombing in the war and flooding from the Thames. There are hundreds of works of art here. These are some of the earliest paintings in the gallery, including this portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First. Penelope Curtis is the director of Tate Britain. It's her job to decide which art pieces are exhibited. Penelope, tell me about Tate Britain. Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art. It was founded by Henry Tate about a hundred years ago. And what does your role involve? I'm the director, and that means looking after everything, but particularly the collections and the displays that you can see in the gallery. And you have some fabulous pictures here, including this very popular one. They say this is our most popular painting. It's hard to know, but it certainly sells the most postcards, but that's rather an old-fashioned measure. What is it about British art that's so exciting? Well, what's particular about British art is that we're an island nation, so things become very concentrated here. People travel from all over the world to be here; other people never leave at all, so things that you might see in the rest of the world become more concentrated in Britain. What's the future of British art and creativity? I think the fact that we don't know is what's exciting about it. Here, we can make history speak to the present and inform what people are doing now, and that's one of our important roles. And the future of British art is bold and exciting. Artistic creativity in Great Britain isn't always found at museums or galleries; sometimes it's worth taking a closer look at the walls around the city. Street art used to be a form of protest and was often painted over by the authorities. These days it's a celebrated art form. Some pieces are worth a fortune. Another art form that is booming in Britain is building computer games. The UK produces more than a quarter of the world's computer games and independent developer Blitz Games Studios here in Leamington Spa has created some top sellers. Popular games like Puss in Boots, Karaoke Revolution and The Biggest Loser are developed here. Blitz Games Studios have a passion for games, technology and creativity. Philip Oliver is a game developer and set up Blitz Games Studios with his brother. Philip, how did this all start? My twin brother and I, Andrew, started playing video games in the early eighties. We got ourselves an 8-bit computer and started writing games just as a hobby but, by the mid-eighties, we were actually able to sell games. We set up Blitz Games Studios and started employing people with the idea we would make games for a global audience, and today we have over 220 talented, creative people making video games for all the biggest publishers in the world. What makes games development so creative? Games are just a fantastic medium. I'm sorry, but I'm absolutely hooked, and I hope so many other people are. We are the entertainment of the twenty-first century. There are no limits. Do you know, when it comes to computer games, I don't think I'm very good at building them. I'm much better at playing them. Yes! Come on! Go up, up, up, up! Get the star! Go on! Go - Oh, no, no, ah.\n",
            "I don't know what it's like with mothers and daughters, but with fathers and sons there is a rivalry, there's bound to be a kind of particularly Brooklyn, now. He's 16, he's becoming his own man and stuff. And it is so funny, like, the way you try to score points against each other. So, Brooklyn put this picture up on Instagram. And he put on it, 'Rocking the old-school Ralph Lauren.' And look at that, it's got 317,000 likes. OK. So that you know, cool in his Ralph Lauren. And you scroll through the comments, you know, 'Oh yeah, whatever', blah, blah, 'What a babe', blah, blah, blah. You get down to this one: Mr David Beckham, 'That's my jumper!' That's so mean! Actually but it actually is my jumper. I was sat at lunch, actually, when that came up on my screen that he'd just posted a picture of him. And it was my jumper so I had to tell him. But I do find him going in my wardrobe, even though he doesn't think I'm that cool a dad, I still find him wearing my clothes every single day. This one's beautiful. So, this is him. It's a little video he posted on Instagram to really boast about the number of his followers. Here we go. So, it's my mum's birthday today. Brooklyn, we're leaving! OK. I just reached a million followers. I've got 52! His face! He is I was We were literally just about to walk out the door and I could hear him talking in his room and I thought And then I heard him say, you know, 'I've just about just reached a million.' So You destroyed that boy! To be honest, you know, when we're out, he gets recognised so much that I'm literally, you know, I'm known as Brooklyn's dad now. And that's kind of it I'm the one that takes the picture of him Yeah, no one's buying that.\n",
            "My name's Alejandra and I'm 13 and, like, on a daily basis, I'll go on my phone in the morning and I'll check my Instagram, Snapchat, KIK, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine. Go to school and then I come back, and I'll use, like, go on Netflix and I'll go in my room and listen to Pandora, Spotify. I'll play on my Xbox, like, Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty and that's about it. If I would add up, like, all the time that I use, I think I would spend about seven to eight hours every day. When I'm on social media I feel like I know what's going on, you know, you do feel a little connected and you know, like what people are up to. Like, you know, I'll post pictures or videos, I'll like, comment on stuff. I don't think I'm addicted to it my phone. I think it's kind of a leash though coz you always have to be on it, and you know and when you hear a buzz, it's like, oh I have friends! I'm Sasha, I'm 16 years old. Currently I have the Xbox 360, MacBook Pro laptop, the iPad, the old Xbox, a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and a PlayStation 4. I like to play a lot of different video games on the console on my PS4 when I get home and I just, you know, veg out sometimes and play I have, you know, first person shooter, like Call of Duty or Battlefield, and we also have a baseball game that I've been playing. I absolutely think that there is an addictive quality to video games. Sometimes I'll, you know, I'll just keep going if I really want to level up on a video game. Usually when I do my homework, when I get home. I'll either come in my room, listen to music or I'll go to the living room and watch TV while I do my homework. If I'm, like, reading something and I, like, get distracted from the TV oh I'll pause it or I'll turn off the music. I'll go through the problem again or whatever I'm working on coz I guess I was a little distracted. If I'm doing my homework on my laptop I might be also having conversations with my friends or intermittently checking my phone. Sometimes if I just get too bored with my homework I might play, like, Candy Crush or something. When I was younger I could go much longer without using media but when I'm in an environment that has a lot of media and all of my friends are all on media then I find it hard to kind of resist.\n",
            "Today we are going to play a game specifically designed to test your spatial awareness. Meet the Brain Games Double Dutch team. Now what does jumping rope have to do with the brain? Well Double Dutch requires off the chart spatial awareness. And today these kids are going to help us test yours. For this game, all you have to do is keep track of the number of times that either of the girls in green, jumps. You'll count each time one of them lands a jump like this... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As you can see these jumpers are pretty quick on their feet so you're going to have to pay attention to keep up. When the whistle blows start counting Ready? Go! So, how many jumps did the green team make? Did you say 38? If so, you agreed with 40 per cent of our test audience. Now, some of you may be on to us but for those of you who aren't. Did you happen to notice anything else going on during the Double Dutch? Maybe a giant chicken strolling right through the middle of the set and doing a funky chicken dance? Now some of you may have missed that funky chicken, but many of you probably saw it, and that's OK, because the chicken was just there to distract you too. Here's the real question. What colour was the wall behind the Double Dutch game? Here's a hint, it wasn't the same colour it was at the end, as it was when they started jumping. The back wall was changing colour the entire time, from bright blue to bright red. Nearly everyone misses it, but why? It turns out that there's far too much information coming in through the eyes at any given moment for the brain to fully process all of it. As a result the brain has to act like a spotlight, focusing our attention on some parts of the scene but not others. Now, most of you were probably paying attention to the jumpers and some of you may have suspected that something strange was going to happen so you saw the chicken but you probably weren't paying attention to the back wall and what we don't pay attention to, we don't see. And er hey, for those of you who managed to catch everything so far, did you notice that we also swapped the rope turners out, halfway through? Gotcha!\n",
            "I see in cities, people are a lot more isolated, everybody's doing their own thing and suddenly I came somewhere where there was space, and Elliston was, like, the real thing. I had a new car that had power steering... and basically I just over-corrected. I was with a friend talking, and saw I was on the other side of the road and just went, 'oops' and I got ejected out of the car, fell on some rocks and straight away I could tell my friend, 'ah, I can't move my legs'. The doctor said... T4... complete paraplegia. I think an accident like this affects everything. Sitting in the chair is the easy bit, you know. Then it's all the incontinence aspect, the skin aspect, learn to have your balance, you just gotta relearn to live a different way. It was pretty hard at the beginning to get back. I had six months in Adelaide in rehab and I was quite good then, but going back to Elliston was difficult because suddenly there were all these things that I love doing that I couldn't do any more. I just used to watch my sons a lot, like, from the house. There's a little way across that I used to go there so I could still see them or you know drive the car as close as I could and watch them surf. I've always been fascinated by it. When we first came up with the idea, you know, I've always thought I wonder if you can go tandem on this, if two can surf on the same board or wondered if you can do all these other things. Well, I reckon I could duct tape you to my back and surf. I don't see why I couldn't. And we tried just here and there and on the deck floor and he just put me on his back and he could get up, so it just started from there. The challenge of getting her on my back and I was, like, if I can do what I normally do with an extra 40 kilos that would be a pretty good challenge, really. I remember just looking up, and just the colour, the sound. It was like being part of everything, being part of the water and I can't even find words to explain that... I'm good friends with Tom and Morgan, her sons, and I'd be like, 'I'm gonna go for a surf' and Pascale would be like, 'Can I come? Can you see?' Yeah, yeah you can see, so she'd just hassle me every time I wanted to go for a surf and I'd be just driving by myself. Why not? Jump in. She'll put herself through anything to be near the ocean. Because I can't... I can't see my body, I feel like if I'm moving, 'cause I've been taped right there at the same height, I can picture it's me. It would be the ultimate thing for Pascale, really. Something that her sons have put a lot of time and effort into, that she gets a close-up look at what's happening. I'm taking a different aspect of it kind of every time now and I'm starting to get it a little bit more too, and just about realising when are we going to wipe out... Yeah, it's changed my life in a way, I think. I mean, I didn't really think about it too much until people started saying comments about how much this inspired them so It's really shown me that you can still have a dream and things are possible. I've always seen Pascale as just being someone who wants to do anything. She's not really the average paraplegic person, that's for sure. You see a wave on a video but if we go to different waves and meet different people and tell them what you can do and what they can do. I mean it might not be their dream, but for them to follow their own dream and to concentrate on the positive in life.\n",
            "Ahh, nothing like an electric fan on a hot day. Err, Edd, I don't think we should be using this much electricity. What do you mean? Well, if we keep using this much electricity then the power plants that provide it will have to work overtime and that will result in the excretion of excessive amounts of greenhouse gases that will travel to the polar ice caps and boil and melt them and cause the sea levels to rise which will ultimately result in extreme weather changes, no doubt causing the Earth to both overheat and flood simultaneously. Don't be silly! Like our electricity usage alone could cause that! Yeah, I guess you're right. Hey, can I have one of those? No. Somebody somewhere is sure using a lot of electricity. And your point is? Huh, I just like to narrate. What's that sound? Holy hot dog in a toaster - it's a giant wave! Hey, Edd. It's not THAT big, I've seen bigger. Err, that's slightly bigger! Quick, Edd, turn everything off before it's too late. How on Earth will that do anything now? Turn everything off now! Oh man, oh man, it's getting closer! Hello? Yeah it's me. Look, I might not be around much longer so I thought I'd better call. Yeah, that's right. With extra anchovies please. Ahhh, it's right in front of me! Oh, that's mildly better. Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I gooooo Well, that's just silly. You know what, guys? I've learned something today. That's right, we do need to seriously consider cutting back on our electricity usage, even if it's just something small like turning stuff off completely before we go to bed, because if we don't we are all going to die. Well, that was the lamest thing I've ever seen, and that rainbow thing was so... wait, is that a giant wave?\n",
            "I've come here to the British Council who work hard to build cultural relations between Britain and the rest of the world, and the English language is a big part of that. Let's find out more. The British Council provides resources for people learning English, and also teachers of English. Martin Peacock is the Director of Global English Product Development. Martin, tell me about English as a global language.Martin: OK, well, many people talk about English as being a global language. And the reasons for that are the widespread use of English. It's used in education, it's used in science and technology and, importantly, English is also used in business.Richard: Are there many global languages?Martin: Well, no, not really. I mean there's 'the' global language which is English in the sense that English is used in these many different contexts; there's only one. There are other languages which are used very widely and spoken by many people in many different places: Cantonese, for example, a variant of Chinese, is spoken in many different places so it's global in a geographic sense and it can be global in the numbers, but in terms of the use in different areas of education, science, research, English is the only global language.Richard: Are there different types of English?Martin: Well, yes, there are lots of different types. There's different accents of English. I come from the north of England, where I have a particular accent. So within England itself, within the UK, there are many variations in English pronunciation and that extends globally, so you see English in America and used in Australia, which is different in accent and also in usage as well.Richard: And what about the impact of technology on a language?Martin: In the past, new words were coined by people - it might have been in a speech or a newspaper article or in a book - they were written down and then other people adapted them and used them, and that could be quite a slow process and new words might come into a language over a long period: 10, 20 years. So technology allows languages to evolve much more quickly.Richard: So technology can change the language, but in what way does it help people to learn the language?Martin: Well, it helps in many ways. In the past, students in locations in other countries didn't have access to much genuine English; they may have a book or an odd newspaper, but what the internet allows them is to read and often to read and translate languages like English on a massive scale. People learn English for different reasons and knowledge of the language is often important in fields like medicine, business and computing. English is becoming more and more important in order to communicate in the international world. English opens doors to employment, education and mobility. And it helps teachers and learners engage across the globe. One of the best ways to learn English is to study in Britain. But what is it actually like to learn English here? My name is Clare, I am 26 and I come from Italy. My course at the North West Academy was very good. I studied grammar, conversation and also words linked with my work placement. The teacher was very good. She has always been available for problems during the lessons and outside the lessons. Over 600,000 learners a year come to Britain to help achieve their ambition, to experience modern UK life. My name is Maximiliano. I'm 23 years old and I'm from Venezuela. Everyone here is very friendly. When you tell them that you're a foreigner, everyone is very welcoming, like everyone tries to speak with you, everyone, like, tries to just stay close to you and ask you about your experience, how your life is in your own country. And that actually helps you a lot, like, when you're not a native speaker. My name is Alexander. My surname Igurov. I'm 24 years old. I'm come to the UK from Russia, from Moscow. I'm studying here business English. Sometimes we have general lessons about social English. I'm engineer in the building company. I will use English in my job. I think it will help me to improve my career. My name's Anthony, and I just turned 24 last February and I'm from Malaysia. The people here are very nice. The place is amazing and learning here is a really different experience, so just come over and check it out. Well, they seem to be enjoying learning English. And what I've learned is, is that the English language is more exciting than I'd first realised. And maybe, just maybe, in the future, I won't have to worry quite as much about my grammar and spelling.\n",
            "London is Britain's business capital. Hundreds of entrepreneurs have set up their high-flying businesses here. Whether commercial, retail or tourism, Britain is the place to be. There are some amazing small businesses popping up all over Great Britain. This is Yarm High Street in the north-east of England where two sisters are really making their mark on the worldwide fashion scene... and they've only just entered their 20s. Let's go and say hello.Emily: Hello, Rock 'N Rose. Emily speaking. Emily and Jess started making jewellery from their mum's garage when they were just 15 years old. Today this British vintage-inspired brand is worn by celebrities, trend-setters, and sold around the world, and their profits are booming. This is their own studio where they make most of the jewellery. There's no stopping these young entrepreneurs. And I want to know what the secret of their success is.Jess: Hi, Richard! Welcome to Rock 'N Rose Come on in Richard: Ladies, tell me. How has the business started from nothing to all of this?Jess: Well, we started back in 2007, and it really started as more of a hobby, part-time, a way of making a bit of cash really, and it kind of grew exponentially from there.Richard: How do you feel when you see your jewellery in magazines and being worn by celebrities?Emily: Sometimes you've got to pinch yourself to really realise how well we're doing and how many magazine features we are getting.Richard: Do you think Great Britain is a good place for entrepreneurs?Jess: Definitely. I think there's a lot of help and advice available out there. I know we had a business advisor from Business Link, the government organisation, and they were invaluable to us, weren't they? And I think there's lots of websites and there's lots of information out there to help people in Great Britain with entrepreneurship. Some companies come from abroad to set up in Great Britain, too. In fact, more overseas businesses choose to set up here in Britain than anywhere else in the world. But, when it comes to British success, this next businessman is one of the best Bannatyne's health club in Darlington is owned by Duncan Bannatyne, one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs, and I'm hoping he'll help me make my first million well, I can dream! Duncan has also become something of a TV celebrity and I can't wait to meet him. Duncan Bannatyne is a multimillionaire. He's the proud owner of 61 health clubs, 3 hotels, 28 day spas and even a bar and the entire empire of the entrepreneur was built through sheer hard work.Richard: You're very successful now, but how did your career begin?Duncan: My career began when I was 29. I was on the beach - I was a beach bum in Jersey. I was just enjoying life, had no money, no bank account. I worked in a bakery for a year and I was 31 years old and I would finish working in the bakery, go to the car auction, buy an old car, do it up, sell it for a profit, and two weeks after we bought our first house, I saw an ice-cream van coming through the auction. I decided to buy it and start a business. In what way is Great Britain a nation of entrepreneurs?Duncan: Great Britain has got a great entrepreneurial spirit and it's coming out quite a lot now since television programmes like The Apprentice and Dragons' Den. Entrepreneurism is about working hard, building a business, but more importantly enjoying that and enjoying life.Richard: So if I was to set up business, what advice would you give me?Duncan: If you set up a business, my piece of advice to you would be to work hard, make it work, and really, really enjoy it.Richard: Glad you mentioned that, Duncan, because I've got an idea for a start-up company. I was just wondering if you'd like to come in and invest and...Duncan: I'm out.Richard: You haven't heard the idea yet so...Duncan: I know. I'm out.Richard: That's a little harsh. Well, I couldn't leave without using the facilities, could I? That's enough of that. Well, I've met some of Britain's greatest entrepreneurs, and it's left me feeling very inspired. In fact, I'm ready to take on the world. Come on! It's this way.\n",
            "Hello, everybody, and welcome back to another video for the LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name is Megan and I'm currently a language assistant in Hanover in Germany. Today I'm on my way to a castle in Bückeburg, which is near Hanover, where I live. And I've heard it's really beautiful so I'm really looking forward to visiting there. As a language assistant I do have a lot of free time and, obviously, I'm really grateful for that and I get to explore lots of different places and things, so I thought I'd bring you guys along with me today. I've just arrived in Bückeburg. Um, it seems very quiet. It seems like there's literally no one here. Um, and I'm not really surprised because it is really, really cold. Hence the hat and fluffy coat, etc. So, I'll try and find somewhere that's a little bit warmer, I think. I've been walking for about twenty minutes now and still can't see a castle, so I think it's time to ask somebody. Look at this amazing church I've just come across! How beautiful is that? Aww, seems like such a nice place. So, I think I've found the right way to the castle. It says it's about half a kilometre away, which isn't so bad. Yeah, it just seems like a really nice place. Well, the castle signs have now disappeared, so am I nearly here? Is this it? Yep, I've found it. And, really looking forward to looking round and exploring what's here. So, I just got back from the castle. I'm back home now. And, just thought I'd let you know I had a really, really great tour. It was really interesting to see why the castle's there and the history behind it all, and, yeah, I'd really recommend if anyone is in the area to go and have a look around. They do do tours in English too, so don't be afraid to ask for a tour in English if you don't speak German. Thanks a lot for watching my video. I really hope you enjoyed it. I will be filming more videos in the very near future and uploading them onto this channel too. If you have any ideas of anything you would like to see, anything you'd like me to film, please let me know in the comments below and I will speak to you again soon! Bye!\n",
            "Hey, everyone! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. I'm kind of in a rush, but I just wanted to tell you what today's video is going to be about. Any guess? Actually, you probably can tell from the title. Anyway, we're on our way to Iceland this morning, so me and my flatmate, Viktoria - who you might have seen in one of our other videos where we were making sushi - are on our way to Iceland for five days. It's our first time that either of us are going, so we're really excited and we just want to show you what we discover really, so if you're interested, keep watching! Hey, guys. So, we made it to the Geyser or we're just about to enter. You can see all the little steam smokes. And Vicky! It was, it was all right... Well, except for the... We went through a very big, like, mist cloud and that was kind of scary, but we're here. We're about to enter, so we'll show you what it looks like when we're closer up. We've just entered the Geyser and we're walking and we've seen that apparently the water is between 80 to 100 degrees, which is very hot. Well, you can see the vapour, so I guess it is quite hot. Maybe a bit too hot for a swim. So, the geyser we went to see was just the baby geyser. We are told that the big geyser can take years to erupt, but when it does it can shoot up into the air as high as 70 metres. The baby geyser's explosion was also impressive and it exploded every ten minutes on average. It's the second day. We are driving. We are driving to the waterfall right now. And then we have some other things planned, like, um, the Diamond Beach, if we can make it that far today. But we will keep you updated. What's your first impression of Iceland? It's so pretty. It's really peaceful for me. So, Vicky, where are we? We're at Gullfoss waterfall. It's pretty cool. Looks Looks icy but also it's steaming so it might be warm. Yeah. Hey, guys! So, we are at our next stop. I actually don't know how to pronounce this waterfall but it is amazing. Vicky's just waiting in the car, but let me show you what it looks like. It's incredible. There's a lot of geothermal energy, a lot of natural springs and a lot of natural waterfalls. So, I'll bring you closer. We'll see what it looks like. Justin Bieber filmed his music video to his song 'I'll Show You' at this very waterfall. Currently I'm on the black beach. It's got black sand, a lot of black rocks and this interesting cave feature. Let's go closer. This black sand beach is made from volcanic activity. It was created by lava flowing into the ocean, which cooled immediately and formed, over time, into these little rocks. Another fun fact, the popular TV series Game of Thrones was filmed at this beach as well as in other famous locations in Iceland. So the sand isn't really sand. It's actually black volcanic rock. Is it volcanic rock? I don't know. I think so, but it's even smaller here. Yeah If you go further down It's crazy. It's very interesting - it leaves no, no sandy marks. So, guys, we have just finished and then we're back in our room and I thought it would be nice to show you what our hostel room for the next two days looks like. Before this, we were staying in an Airbnb closer to the capital but now we are in Skógar - I think that's how you pronounce it - and this is just what a typical hostel room looks like. It's a private one, so there's only two bunks. As you can see, I'm up here and Vicky will be down there. We have a little sink, and here is Vicky! I was just showing them the room and explaining what a hostel-style room looks like. So I was saying how we have bunks but if you're in a shared dormitory, then you'll have, like, six or eight of these, or even ten and it's cheaper. And it's cheaper because then it's, like, per head that you pay for the room. But sometimes you can get male only and female only, and sometimes it's mixed. But, yeah, this is our little room for the next few days. We're just going to relax for this evening and then we'll show you what we're doing tomorrow, I guess. Good morning, guys! It's our fourth and practically final day, erm, in Iceland, and we're just about to leave our hostel, but before we do, there's this really cool waterfall that we're going to check out! As you can see, there's loads of waterfalls in Iceland. I think that's the main thing we've been seeing. But this is a big one! But this is a big one, and I think we can climb to the top so we're going to try and do that now. We're about to try and climb all the way up here. I don't know if you can see, that's actually quite a lot of stairs. I don't... I wonder how tall it is? I'm sure we'll find out. The best thing about the Skógarfoss Waterfall is how close you can get up to the crashing water. It's an incredible experience. So, guys, we finally made it to Diamond Beach. The ice has melted along the sealine, but there is still big chunks of ice right there. No diamonds. No diamonds. I thought she was going to get me a diamond ring but But um The water is, like, really blue and so is the ice and we're wondering why that is. We actually don't know. The reflection maybe Do you think it's to do with the minerals, though, in the water? I don't know. Maybe. The Blue Lagoon was also really blue, but it looks really pretty and it's a nice sunny day so we're enjoying the sun.\n",
            "Hi, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. This weekend I'm actually in England. I've come home just for two nights. I'm not actually coming home for Christmas this year because I'm going to experience what a German Christmas is like, but, um, yeah, I've come home the weekend before just to see my family and to catch up with them. I'm currently at my dad's house and it's so festive, I love it! And I'm going to show you around a little bit. Um, maybe you're interested in what an English home might look like at Christmas time, and yeah! So, we're on the way to Ripley. We're going to go get a drink, yeah? With my dad and my sister. My sister's driving me. I'm not going to lie - I'm a little bit scared! She, um, when did you pass your test, Frey? June She passed her test in June and obviously I've been in Germany, so she hasn't driven me around too much, but it's going all right so far. So, we just had a nice drink in the café. We're in a small village called Ripley, which is about two miles from where my dad's house is. This is my dad. Say hi. Hello! And we're now going on a small walk, next to the castle walls. Another castle! Um, yeah, and it's a really nice day. It's really sunny and it's really good to be home. So, it's a lot later on now. I'm back at my mum's house. She's got the fire on really cosy. I say really cosy, but unfortunately her central heating has broken and it's December, so when you leave this room, it feels very, very cold in this house, which isn't the best! So, I'm just watching, what're we watching? Strictly Come Dancing. Um, everyone in Britain is obsessed with this programme. And my best friend, Ailsa... Hi! is with me and, yeah, we've just had a Chinese and I've not had a Chinese for a long time. It was good, it was good. I haven't had Chinese since August, so, it was really nice. And yeah! Just chilling. Got a cup of tea Yeah, Ailsa's actually a singer. What's your, what do you type into YouTube to find you? 'A' So, Ailsa Gray, and it's A-I-L-S-A, and then Gray, with an 'A'. So, just Ailsa Gray? Ailsa Gray. And then ailsagraymusic on Instagram. Yeah, and Spotify. And Spotify. Just type in Ailsa Gray. And she's such a good singer, and so if you guys want something new to listen to, definitely go listen to her! Thanks! You're welcome. Haha. Sorry, sorry! It's OK. We were just talking about what it's like to live abroad, because you've never lived abroad. I've never lived abroad, and I've always wanted to live abroad. But I'm so scared, just because of, like, the language barrier and stuff. It is hard at the beginning. I was thinking about making a video on this, actually. Um, maybe some tips for living abroad for anyone who might be interested. Like housing, as well, like, getting housing when the language is completely, like, it's hard enough in your own language, but in a different language. Yeah. It is. It's kind of, everything is that extra bit more effort. Yeah. Takes longer. Everything takes longer to do. But it's worth it in the end. It's the next day now, and my mum and I are about to head to town. We're going to go to Marks & Spencer's, to places basically that I can't go to in Germany and I'm really excited, as sad as that sounds, I'm really excited to do that. And I need to get some Tetley tea for one of the teachers at the school that I work at, because, again, you can't, you just can't get that in Germany, and yeah and I'm flying home tonight which is crazy because I feel like I've just arrived. It's only been two nights that I've been here. Yeah, so I've literally been here for two nights. It's gone so quickly! But, I am excited to go back to Germany because I love it there, and... yeah, need to go back to school and got one more week of teaching and then it's the Christmas holidays, which... it's going to be my first Christmas in Germany so, yeah, I'm really looking forward to that.\n",
            "When I was a teenager most of the food that I was giving my pigs was actually perfectly fit for human consumption. It was coming from supermarket dumpsters; bins full of food being locked and sent off to landfill sites. And I thought well I'm just scratching the surface here. At least a third of the world's food supply is currently being wasted. When you add it all up it amounts to an enormous environmental catastrophe and a major contributor to the scarcity of food in some parts of the world. The ridiculously strict cosmetic standards laid down by supermarkets in Europe and America mean that farmers in Kenya waste thousands of tonnes of perfectly good food every single year right where there are millions of people hungry. This is the food waste from one day of packing, in one plant in Kenya. Multiply that by many times and you start to see the scale and the gratuitousness of the global food waste scandal. Tristram speaking to market stall holder: “So I want to take this but I also... can I have a look at your other bins around the back?” I'm going to take that because that is actually really really good pig food. At root, what we need to change is society. We need to make everyone believe that food is far too valuable to waste. I'm a founder of the charity, Feedback. What we do as an organisation is try and inspire people to take action in their own lives. That's our number one objective - to spread the global food waste revolution. We find that the best way of doing that is to hold a massive free feast with food that otherwise would be wasted so people are having fun whilst building solutions and collaborating with each other to use food rather than throwing it away. Tristram speaking at a food feast: “Supermarkets who used to reject stuff because it didn't look perfect have changed their ways. Food redistribution has doubled in the UK since we launched our campaigns and we can, and we will, change the whole way the food system is being run and it's our responsibility to do that”. I've been campaigning on food waste for twenty-two years. In that period I have seen food waste gone from a neglected issue that no one knew about to one that is now treated as a global priority. We can change this system and if we don't no one else will!\n",
            "Hi, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name is Megan, if you haven't watched any of my videos before on this channel, and I'm living in Berlin at the moment. I was living in Hanover at the beginning of my year abroad and now I'm living in Berlin. So, I thought I'd make a video about the things that I personally find to be so different between the UK and Germany. And these things, these are all things that probably every day crop up in my life and continue to surprise me. But, yeah, I just thought this might be an interesting video if you have never been to Germany and would like to see what it's like, or the other way round, if you've never been to the UK and want to see some differences between the two different countries. So, in order to highlight some of the main differences between Germany and the UK, I've actually written a list of five things that you should do in Germany that you wouldn't necessarily do in the UK. So the first one on my list is definitely use public transport. I think Germany is sort of known worldwide for its public transport system and the idea that it's always punctual and always on time, that trains are never late. This idea might be a bit construed but Deutsche Bahn definitely knows how to provide a more reliable and enjoyable service than the one that we have in the UK. It also makes a lot more sense to me to use public transport when it's here in such great availability. You know, where I live in Berlin now there's an underground that runs every three to four minutes. Or I can get on a bus or I can get on a tram. So there's loads of different options. And if I were to get a taxi or to drive anywhere, it would just take so much longer and you'd be sat in traffic. And, yeah, also I want to note that Berlin's underground system is so much quieter than London's. Germany - I mean Berlin, sorry - has a much smaller population size and therefore is not as crowded, it's not as hot, it's not as uncomfortable as London's and therefore, yeah, you should definitely use it if you come to Berlin and definitely use public transport across all of Germany really. I've never really had a bad experience, and, yeah, it's something I'd definitely recommend. So the second thing on my list and the second thing you should do in Germany that you wouldn't necessarily do in the UK, although you should, is do wait for the green man. Um, I think we Brits have quite a bad reputation for seeing the road is clear and just crossing, regardless of whether it's on red or green. And obviously I do not recommend this; it's not a great idea at all, in any circumstance, but we do do it. I definitely am guilty of sometimes just thinking, well, the road's clear, I'm just going to cross. But in Germany, that's definitely not a thing. Unless you want to be tutted at by the old lady stood next to you, definitely wait for the green man. Um, yeah, it's just not something Germans do, it's not something Germans, erm they don't will always criticise you for doing it. It's just not seen as a good thing to do. So, yeah, always wait for the green man. So the third thing you should do in Germany that you wouldn't necessarily need to do in the UK is have cash on you. So, in the UK we're quite a cashless society. A lot of people won't have cash on them if they have their cards with them, because it's pretty much everywhere you are able to use your debit or credit card. But something that continues to surprise me in Germany is the fact that they are such a cash-using society. So often you won't be able to pay by card or they will say you can only pay by card if it's over, if the price of the transaction is over ten euros. So this is something I've really struggled actually to get used to, because when I was in the UK, I'd always just get out my debit card and often just use contactless payment, so that would just mean I just swipe it on and it was done, but here it's so often, 'Oh, I need to go and get cash out', so, yeah, I would always recommend if you're in Germany to have a bit of cash on you so that you're not, yeah, stuck not being able to pay for something. Because that's definitely happened to me a few times, where I've got to the till, I'm looking forward to buying something and they say, 'No, we don't take debit cards.' So, yeah, I'd always have some cash on you if you're in Germany. The final thing I would recommend that you should do in Germany that you can't, well, that you don't really have to worry about in England, or in the UK, is stocking up, and by stocking up I mean preparing, and having food or anything that you need in on a Saturday because on Sundays in Germany everything is shut, apart from restaurants and cafés. So supermarkets, clothes shops, basically most places are shut, whereas in the UK Sunday is quite a big shopping day actually. I would often, when I was at uni, do my food shop for the week on a Sunday, or I might go into town and buy a new top or look around the shops, but that's just not an option in Germany. Everything is shut. So, if you want to be able to eat on a Sunday, then definitely make sure you have some food in the fridge on the Saturday so that you aren't starving on Sunday. And, yeah, I think that rounds up my four things that you should do in Germany that you can't, well, not that you can't do in the UK, just things that you should do in Germany that you don't necessarily think about if you're in the UK or from the UK. So, I really hope you enjoyed this video. I'm definitely planning on making a lot more soon, so if you want to leave any comments of things that you want me to talk about in the future, then just comment them down below. Thanks for watching.

            "Have you? Err no. No? I have, when I was little. Well, when I was earlier, younger, I was bullied for about my height and about boys who used to be jealous that I was taller than them, so they used to bully me and yeah... They used to call her a giraffe. Yeah. I've been in groups of friends where I've had jokes about me made more than other people did for example, but I wouldn't say I'd been bullied like consistently. Like, I was friends with a lot of people, but at the same time like, I was an easy target, I mean, I am and yeah... they used to pick on me a lot. I used to be a teacher, so I've certainly seen plenty of bullying in the classroom. Oh yeah, definitely, erm, I mean... I was bullied a little bit in my earlier high school experience, like I had blue hair and like I wore the fingerless gloves and everything, so, like, it... it's difficult but... you know, like... it's... I actually did, erm like, I ended up going to therapy for a little while, so like I've met a lot of people who have gone through bullying and it's like one of those things you have to kind of help each other out... yeah. I had an argument with a boy which then led to turned into a fight. I was in the classroom. People were constantly calling me a tramp and saying I live in a pit. Then, I was saying stuff back to them, the teacher caught me saying that and was going to send me out. She... she heard them... she was te... she didn't do anything... um... she just completely ignored them and then when I said something back to them, she was going to send me out on... I packed all my things away and walked out of school back to home. This teacher come running after me and I completely ignored her while she carried on to shout my name. I felt a bit sad because... erm... I was ignoring the teacher and all she was trying to do was help. Probably yes, yeah, erm... I think it's easy to get, especially with the dynamics of a group, drawn into saying something that you wouldn't say on your own, for example, yeah. I think if you define bullying in a very kind of open way, then yes, I think probably we're all capable of bullying. I don't know. I suppose maybe I was slightly different to them, I don't know really... I don't know, erm, boredom? Something to do? They got a kick out of it? I think obviously bullying allows you to feel... um... a sense of superiority over the person you're doing it to. Now why people want to feel a sense of superiority... is a different question, I guess, err... there's probably something that they're making up for... that might just be received wisdom, I don't know. Why? Erm... probably because they're jealous that I was taller than them... or because... I don't know... they just, the boys were boys and they're... I don't know. Bullying has changed the way I live my life today. It's knocked my confidence down and I never wanted to go to school again. 'Why do you think you were bullied?' I have a low form of autism. My anxiety is much higher than everyone else's and caused me to have many days off. Students thought I was skiving so started to bully me for it. 'How did you feel and what did they do?' I felt constantly upset, they would tell me I had homework when I didn't, meaning I was constantly stressed and they even made a song about me having days off. So like, I think it like definitely changed me in a big way, because now I know what I want to do with my life and I know who I am and that that's OK. I could get quite angry about it, but I don't and actually I know what they're all up to now and I know that I've probably come out better than they have. I've actually decided that I want to study psychology and I'm going to be a therapist, so, because I'd just like to help people... Well, looking back on it I kind of just laugh about it because it's... stupid to just bully in general. It always makes me like... stop before I say things, even though that doesn't actually happen much any more. I've grown comfortable with people I'm with now though. I realised bullying it really doesn't matter, like... you just have to be yourself, so it kind of like helps you realise... like... it, it hurts for a while, but at the same time it helps. I think it's, it's probably something we still don't do enough about.\n",
            "Today I'm going to talk to two young people who are both doing voluntary work in the sports sector. First there's Liam Parker, who is a keen BMX biker and does a lot of work at a sports centre. And then there's Debbie Sanford, who has volunteered to help with many different sports, and who now has a paid job with a sports organisation. So, Liam, tell us a bit about the place you work - it sounds really interesting. Yes, it's really cool. Basically it's a huge space where lots of sports and cultural events take place. It used to be a shipbuilding hangar, but the company went bust years ago. The building was taken over and completely renovated and repurposed about five years ago. Now we have facilities for all kinds of urban sports like skateboarding, breakdancing, Parkour, kick scooter Hang on a moment, can you explain the last two? A kick scooter is just a normal scooter with a handlebar, deck and wheels. But now we have stunt scooters and special ones for racing. And Parkour has been around for a while now. It's a way of moving around an urban environment - it developed from military training. It involves climbing, running, vaulting, jumping, swinging and stuff like that. Everyone's seen it on TV and videos, people jumping off incredibly high buildings, between roofs and things. So what are you involved with? My passion is for BMX, and I want to get other people involved in the sport. But I do all kinds of things at the centre. I make sure the bikes and scooters meet safety standards. I check the tracks and ramps so that they are clean and no one can slip and hurt themselves. I teach kids the basics of BMX and do demonstrations. I sometimes cook in the burger van too. Right, so you've learned a lot of skills? Yeah. At first I was a bit nervous about speaking to groups, but now I have no problem giving safety inductions to people. I had to learn sports-specific first aid in case anyone hurts themselves, cooking hygiene for the burger van, maths for taking money at the till. I've had a lot of training in different areas and gained useful certificates. So all that training will be valuable when you come to look for paid work? Absolutely. I'm still only 18 and I've been volunteering for two years. I'd like to stay in this sector and find full-time paid work, so obviously all my experience and skills will help a lot. Thank you, Liam. And now, our other guest has made that jump from voluntary work to paid work. Debbie, you've been involved in many different sports in your 22 years, haven't you? Yes, quite a few! I started off playing football at county level and then got into coaching. I reckoned that I wouldn't have been able to play football without the help of volunteers, so when I had the chance to help other people, I did. Then I started a degree in Sport Development and I realised that lots of people like me would soon have a degree and be looking for a job and I'd need more experience to compete with them all! So you volunteered again? Yes, I spent a year helping with an online sports volunteering bureau and volunteered at various events including a cricket tournament, a table tennis championship and a half marathon. Wow, that's a lot of experience! Yes. I must add that I don't actually play cricket or table tennis myself, though I do run. You don't have to be an expert in a sport to volunteer - there are lots of jobs that need doing. And now you've finished your degree and you're working. That's right. I wrote my dissertation on the retention and recruitment of volunteers, and now I manage volunteers for an organisation promoting swimming. I also organise events at a national level. I would never have got the job without all my volunteering experience. It helped me loads. And finally, a question for you both. Do you think we sometimes exploit volunteers in this country? Are they doing things for free when they ought to be getting paid? Liam, I believe that you volunteer for about ten or twenty hours a week. Do you ever feel that you should be paid for what you do? Well, of course, it would be nice. But the organisation I help is non-profit-making and it couldn't really afford to pay all the volunteers. At the moment, I'm happy to do what I love and gain experience of dealing with the public. I'm living with my parents and they are paying my keep. In the future I'll have to look for paid work. I think many volunteers feel they want to give something back to their sport. It was like that for me with football. Ideally it would be good to have more paid positions, but we also need volunteers. Sport just couldn't function without them. It is really important to give people recognition for what they do, though. Thanks very much for sharing your experiences. And now, we're going to move on\n",
            "Hi, everyone. On today's Tech-times podcast we're lucky to have Sam Wogan, a well-known digital journalist, with us. So, Sam - what interesting techie-topic would you like to talk about today? Hi Brad. Today I'd like to talk about some of the reasons why we shouldn't automatically believe everything we read online, and how false information spreads so easily with the help of technology. One of the reasons for this is a phenomenon known as circular reporting. Circular reporting? What's that? Well, it's basically reports which are based on other reports, rather than on the primary evidence or source. To the reader, it looks like the information is coming from several different independent sources, which normally means it can be trusted. But, in actual fact, all the reports are based on each other. Imagine a piece of false information is published, for example on Wikipedia, and then is referenced in a newspaper article or other publication. Then, in turn, the original Wikipedia entry references or quotes the article as validation that the information is true. In a nutshell, it's the confirmation of false information by more than one publication. OK, let me see if I've understood this correctly. So, someone writes an article on Wikipedia which contains some false information... That's right, false information which is not referenced or checked and in no way is obvious as being false. OK, and then this false information is copied from Wikipedia by a journalist and included in a newspaper article. Yes, or other type of article, as if it were true information. And then Wikipedia references the newspaper article, which verifies the information in the original Wikipedia article as being true. That's right! And sometimes it's not just one newspaper article that cites the false information. Several publications may include it and so it becomes very difficult to prove that the original information is false. Let me give you an example. A few years ago a 17-year-old American student was on holiday with his family in Brazil. He spotted what he believed to be an aardvark, but which was in fact a type of Brazilian raccoon called a coati. When the boy got home after his holiday, he went online and changed the Wikipedia entry by adding the name 'Brazilian aardvark' to the information on the article, as a sort of joke, and then he forgot about it and thought nothing more of it. However, what started to happen was that articles and blogs began to quote the information from Wikipedia and then those articles were re-reported as evidence in Wikipedia. Before long, everyone was talking about the 'Brazilian aardvark' as if it were factual information. So when information makes its way from a Wikipedia page into a published article, the article could be spreading false information without even realising it? Exactly! It makes you wonder how many hoaxes initiated by people in this way have ended up as truths in many people's minds just because people copy and paste vandalised Wikipedia pages. That's not to say that all information on Wikipedia is false by any means. There's a ton of really valid information there and it is constantly being updated - many people consider it to be the most up-to-date and unbiased encyclopaedia in the world. However, it is the open structure of Wikipedia, compared to a traditional encyclopaedia, which makes it a target to be tampered with. So we just have to be aware that there may be a certain amount of inaccuracies on Wikipedia? Yes, and it's also worth mentioning that circular reporting is not just restricted to harmless information like the 'Brazilian aardvark'. Isn't it? No. For example, some time ago, claims that certain vaccines could cause autism in children were published in a prestigious medical publication by a British surgeon. The problem was that the unsupported claims were picked up by the media and the news spread like wildfire. Soon enough the general public were understandably concerned about the risks and huge numbers of parents refused to vaccinate their children. Consequently, in recent years we have seen an increase in the number of children suffering childhood diseases such as measles. By the time the claims were proven unfounded, the damage was done and even to this day some people still believe that there is a link between vaccines and autism. It just goes to show how difficult it is sometimes for the truth to be heard. Absolutely. So, in practical terms, how can we be sure that what we're reading is true? Well, we can take certain steps such as checking the original source of the information and, if at all possible, checking that the original source is reliable and not just taken from either Wikipedia, Facebook or the media. Right, so we need to be a little more critical and not just believe everything we read online. That's right, although it's difficult because we want information quickly and immediately, so it's not always viable to spend time checking the sources of information, even though we should. And we should certainly try and reflect on the information and decide ourselves if we think it's true or not. If you feel unsure about the validity of certain information, then there's no harm in looking into it further to check how true it actually is. That's very true. We often take things at face value and don't really take the time to think critically about them.\n",
            "In the UK something amazing happens every five years: we hold a General Election. On this one day every eligible person in the UK can place a vote and be part of electing their local representative to Parliament. Parties and candidates campaign to win votes by visiting constituents door to door, holding debates and publishing manifestos, a bit like a shopping list of what they plan to do if they're voted in. But how does the election work? The UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by one Member of Parliament. Voters register for a polling card to make sure they can take part. On Election Day, polling stations are open from dawn till dusk. And if a voter can't make it along, there are other ways to make sure they can take part. Once every vote has been placed, the ballots are counted to find out which candidate has come out on top in each area. This is called 'first past the post'. The elected MPs enter Parliament to sit in the House of Commons and represent everyone in their constituency. The political party with the most MPs, the majority, is invited by the Queen to form a government. And if there's a hung parliament, where there's no clear winner, then a minority government or a coalition government may be created, or a fresh election held. So, on this one day, a little piece of paper with your mark plays a big role in deciding who leads our country.\n",
            "Let's talk about the hoodie. The hoodie is a symbol of comfort, something that I throw on because I'm feeling lazy that day. For something that started as a really basic piece of sportswear, the hoodie is everywhere: college campuses, the workplace, concerts, protests. How'd that happen? The hoodie is an example of how fashion can contain important different social contexts. Hoods have been around forever. If we were just talking about the origin of hoods, you'd probably have to travel back in time. But the hooded sweatshirt is much more recent. It was developed in the 1920s by Champion sports apparel. Athletes would complain about their heads feeling cold. It probably contributed to that myth that 50 to 70 per cent of body heat is lost out of your head. That's been debunked. You see, Mom, I told you! So Champion added a hood to their cotton sweatshirts, but they weren't able to patent the hood, making it open season for other designers to explore. This new sweatshirt caught on immediately, especially on college campuses. One thing the hoodie works really well for is custom graphic printing. It's like this blank canvas that you can plaster with your sorority, university name or team mascot - pretty much anything that you want. The popularity of this sporty casual item even caught the eye of designers like Coco Chanel, who began using textiles like jersey to make more sportswear-inspired clothing in the 1920s. Sportswear got another fashion push in the '80s from designers like Norma Kamali and continues today. Just look at the current 'athleisure' trend. Hoodies stopped showing up exclusively on athletes and started showing up on everyone - myself included. That's the thing about the hoodie. It wasn't designed to be flashy, just comfortable. It's a very democratic piece of clothing. That universal appeal is also probably why the hoodie occasionally has such different cultural connotations. For example, a hood provides a degree of anonymity, a feature that comes in handy when you're trying to duck authorities. Say you were a skateboarder trying to find a cool spot to skate, or a graffiti artist trying to avoid being ID'd. The hoodie was a useful tool in exploring these artistic expressions that occasionally required bending the law. Hey! So at the same time you have models wearing hoodies down a runway, you have people calling to outlaw hoodies in public places. And this dichotomy between casual sportswear and banned clothing can clash in a big way. That's what happened when a call to the police reported Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen, as a suspicious character based merely on the combination of his skin colour and a hoodie. Trayvon's hoodie acted as a blank canvas that his killer used to project his suspicion. Millions have pointed out that only two months after the Trayvon incident, Mark Zuckerberg made news by wearing a hoodie to a big meeting with Wall Street investors. There's no reason why Mark Zuckerberg or I should be able to wear a hoodie, but someone else can't. The hoodie provides this really unique look at the flexibility of fashion, how society can take an item of clothing and can apply different cultural meanings. For me, the hoodie represents comfort and a unique slice of fashion available to everybody.\n",
            "Hello and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name is Molly and today I'm here with my friend Jose. Hello. Today we're going to make a video about learning English. And I wanted to make this video with Jose because she's from Argentina and I thought it would be really interesting and useful for you guys to hear her perspective, and what her experience has been learning English, instead of me just talking, as a native speaker. First off, I wanted to ask you a bit about your background. So, what is your background studying English, like, when did you start and why did you start learning English? OK, so I started when I was eight. And I started, like, for sheer coincidence because a friend of mine from school was going to take English classes and she didn't want to go alone, so her mum was like, 'Oh, could Jose come with her?' and I was like, 'Sure.' And once I started, like, I never looked back. I really liked it. It's really normal here in Argentina to start learning English at a very early age and I haven't stopped ever since. Now I'm studying English at university. Yeah, and going to be an English teacher. Yeah. I wanted to ask, what has been the hardest thing about learning English? Well, I think the big, difficult thing most of the times is grammar for a lot of students and knowing when to apply certain grammar functions, I guess, especially when they don't translate into your own language. Yeah. So, I'm a native Spanish speaker and, for example, for us it was very difficult to learn passive voice. Yeah. That was like the one that everyone hated. Yeah. Because you don't really use it. And we use it a lot. Yeah, exactly. I think those kind of equivalences that language 'miss' with the others, is kind of the tricky part because you cannot picture it in your own language, as, like, with vocabulary, for example. You have an equivalent word for, well, almost everything. Have you had anything - any technique or any, I don't know, activity or stimulus - that you've used that's really helped you improve your English? Um, I think exposing yourself to real language is very important. Er, I mean with English, the advantage of English is that it's so spread throughout the world that you don't have an excuse not to do it. Yeah, haha. Even if you turn on the TV, you'll find movies in English and I think that's very good. That, like, trains your brain to listen to real English and try to understand real English, er, incorporate words that you wouldn't find in a textbook. When I was learning French, that was something that really struck me, like, here, maybe in Argentina you're not exposed to French content, or French-speaking people so it's very difficult to do that, but with English that's very accessible, like, just with an internet connection, you Yeah. And you watch a lot of YouTube. Yeah. So that can be a useful thing. Yeah. YouTube is a very good tool when you use it correctly. And since there's so much different content on YouTube you can find whatever it is you like. If you like video games, if you like books, if you like just watching people live! You can find anything that interests you. And just listening to it, like, stimulates you in a way that maybe a normal class of English wouldn't. Yeah. You've talked a bit already, but do you have any other tips or anything for people that are learning English? I think one thing about learning languages and English is that you can do it at any stage of your life. A lot of people think that you have to start learning when you're young. Yeah. And if you don't, then you're never going to reach... Yeah - you're never going to speak as well as you wish. I don't think that's true. I think learning a language is practice, like, you have to commit to it. You can't just go to class, listen to the teacher, do the stuff that they ask you and that's it. Like, maybe you'll do it, but it will take much longer. Like, practising a lot, trying to place things into context, like, 'Oh, this thing that I learned, I could apply it here, in real life.' Yeah, totally. Yes. And again, exposing yourself to music, movies, series, books, I think, makes a big change, it makes a very big difference. And it helps us to sound more erm... genuine, which maybe when you're in class, you're thinking about all these, like, grammar rules and this specific vocabulary and you're, like, twisting yourself in all of this and you forget, like, the real reason is to communicate. Yeah, totally. Yeah. You can use and shape the language in whatever way you want. Practice and exposure are two good ways of learning a language. Yeah, I agree. Like, from my experience the other way round, learning Spanish, that's totally what's helped me the most. You've got to commit, as well, like you said. 'Cause learning a language is a long process but it's definitely worth it, from my experience, from your experience, I think we would both say that, like, it's a hundred per cent worth it to learn a language. It helps you be more open-minded, be more mindful of the people around you, it helps you explore the world in a different way Yeah. Cool. Well, that was all the questions that I had, so thank you for being in this video. Thank you for having me. Hopefully the discussion of Jose's perspective has been helpful to some of you guys that are also learning English. I hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "And there's only one thing for us to do now but to make the card and it is very, very simple. All you need is a piece of coloured card, a piece of white card, a picture/photo, a yoghurt lid, some glitter, pipe cleaners and an old magazine as well. So it's time to get crackalacking. The very first thing that you do is you put a load of glue on the coloured card and we're then going to stick that onto the white card. The white card just enables us to write our message on the inside of the card and it makes the card a little bit sturdier when it takes pride of place on my mum's mantelpiece, which is exactly where this one's going. No doubt about that. So once that's done, you can see, that's the basic foundation of the card. But I'll move that to one side and I'll focus on the snow globe. So this is a picture I've got here of Hacker and Dodge. You might recognise these two little rascals. I downloaded this from the CBBC website. You can do that yourself or you can have a personalised card, so you can have perhaps a loved one or whoever or whatever you want. Then with that yoghurt lid, this is my window onto the card, I'm gonna choose where I want it. I'll have it just about there. And I wanna draw a circle on, around. You don't need to be particularly neat. That'll become clear in just a second and that's because when you cut around the edge we actually don't even want you to get particularly near to the line. Leave a nice little margin because it'll make the following stage just that bit easier. The thing I love about this card is the fact that you can include anyone you want on it. So it's not a generic card. You can make it CBBC-tastic or personalised for your loved one. And once you've done that you can then just put your yoghurt lid there, like so. Take a piece of sticky tape out and then begin to stick the picture onto the lid. And once you've done that and you've stuck all the way around the edge, you'll have something which looks like this. Now, you will also note that there's actually an opening there and that is where our glitter is going to go in. That is what's going to make the snow effects that we want. How much glitter I put in? All of it. Cos as we say at Christmas time, 'the more the merrier'. So there. Merrier. It's Christmas time! Anyway, no laughter, we're going to move on and we're gonna seal the rest of the lid with a bit of sticky tape there. And, again, you'll have a little bit more time than I have got here. And once that's done that should hopefully seal all the glitter. I'll give it a shake just to check. That looks done to me. Now I'll bring the original card back and I'm gonna stick the snow globe onto it. Now, I'm putting the glue onto the card, rather than the snow globe cos it does make things that bit easier. When that's done, it's now time to decorate. My favourite part. So we want it to look as much like these beautiful creations as possible. You can see this is where the pipe cleaners come in. So, you take your pipe cleaner and you wrap the pipe cleaner around the yoghurt lid. And as you can see, it does cover the edge. But just a little point, you can see I've left probably a bit too much of an edge there. So although we want you to leave an edge around the lid, don't leave too much. Just so that way the pipe cleaner can help cover it. And if you've got time to glue that down, that's exactly what I'll do and I'll also add a bit of a border as well. And when you've done that, you'll have something which looks like this. So we've nearly got the finished product right here. It is... ooooh! Sound effects. Can we hear that again? We can't... there we go. And it's just time to put the 's' of 'Christmas' on. This is where the old magazine comes in. This 's' was taken from a magazine headline which said, 'Shock, horror, Lindsey Russell only took two hours in make-up this week.' That's right. There you go, ha ha ha! And there we have our finished Christmas card. I'll give it a little shake there.\n",
            "I don't know about you but buttons are always falling off my clothes. Here's our step-by-step guide to replacing a button with my workshop tailor, Michael. A trick to make this look good when it's done is to leave a space between the button and the garment and to give us that space, I'm going to use matchsticks. It'll make the button lie nice and flat. So first of all you need a mark as to where your button is going to sew, on this jacket where the button's come off there is a mark. Come in from the side of the marking, pull your thread through but leave the end dangling. Now, to secure the thread we are going to make a loop, pass the needle through the loop, pull that tight and that's secured your thread. In from the back of the button, back into the mark and pull it tight but remember put your match, or whatever you are using for the spacing, underneath. Pull the thread tight; this gives us a distance. Don't pull the thread too tight because we don't want the button to be too tight. Repeat the process maybe three, four times. I'm using very strong button thread. It's much better than ordinary sewing thread. Make sure you always come back through the same hole. I'm now moving over to the other holes in the button and I'm going to do the same again and make sure I'm sewing it over the match. Push your thread up behind the button but don't go through the holes, take your match out, get your thread and wind it three or four times around the stitches. This gives what we call a shank. Then finally push your needle through to the back. Then we are going to do a knot on the back. Same process that we did on the front, make a loop, thread your needle through, pull that tight. That's secured it. Push your needle into the fabric, pull it through, cut off the end, cut off the end on the front of the garment and you have one button with a shank. There's a little gap between the button and the garment. So when it does up, the buttonhole is not going to pull.\n",
            "Hi everybody. I'm Jeff Seagle. Good to see so many people here. As you know, I've been asked to come along and give you some advice about how to break into the music industry. And before I start I'd better make it clear that this talk is for people wanting to work with and for artists, not to actually be musicians, OK? Right, so I've been in the music biz for quite a number of years now, and I've worked with a lot of amazing people. So here are my tips, for what they're worth. First of all, I know a lot of you are thinking about further degrees, but forget the MBA. This business is much more about experience than qualifications, so it's better to start working as soon as you can. Easier said than done, you might say, but I'm talking about any kind of relevant work experience. Don't panic - you can start small! Go along to your local music venue or a small music company in your home town and see if there's anything you can do. It could just be selling tickets on the door - you'll get to meet people and one thing might lead to another. Obviously paid work is better than unpaid, but you have to start somewhere. You need to be in an environment where you are learning stuff and making contacts. Ah, a question already - yes? What about being an intern? Are there many internships available nowadays? There definitely are some. Not a huge number — as you know, it's a very competitive industry, but the bigger companies certainly do take on people. And if you get your foot in the door at a big place you've really got to prove your worth. Show the higher-ups that you have some kind of unique skill or knowledge. Maybe something to do with social networking, or even knowledge of the music scene in the place you grew up. If you possibly can, let them see that you have something special to offer, and with any luck, they'll keep you on. Remember that companies often want interns because they're young and have their finger on the pulse. Show them that you know what's going on, what people are listening to, how to find new acts, and so on. Find a cool app that they don't know about. OK, another question? How important is networking? Meeting people and making connections is absolutely vital. If people see you as an ambitious 'networker', if they think you're just using them, that's not so good. Nobody wants to feel like a stepping stone in someone else's career. But people are often willing to give younger people the benefit of their experience and, of course, we're all susceptible to a bit of flattery. So my advice is to find people in the business you genuinely admire and ask them questions. If you're an intern, start with your boss, then move on to others in the building, after getting your boss's permission. It's also good to chat to anyone who shares your passion for music, people on the door in clubs, band members, fans or music executives. You never know what information might be useful or which contact may help you in the future. Oh, and one other point about networking, bear in mind that nowadays the personal and professional lines are sometimes blurred. That means that anything you post online for your friends to see can also be seen by potential professional contacts. Make sure that everything people can see about you reflects the image you want to project. Next question from over there? You've talked about the music industry, but I'm not sure what kind of jobs are available exactly. Could you give some examples? Sure, and that's a good point. You need to work out what you're best at, and what you feel most passionate about, and let that guide your career path. It could be working in publicity, promoting artists; working in A&R, discovering new talent and matching artists up with musical collaborators; booking acts for TV shows; helping a new band become successful by working with their management team. And of course now there are hundreds of jobs connected to the internet. You could be managing a website or blogging for a label. Or social media manager for a band - running their social media channels. Things are changing so fast - a lot of the music portals we use today have only been in existence a short time. Who knows what's coming next and what new jobs will be created? Thanks, that's really useful. I also wanted to ask how you deal with celebrities. Have you worked with many? Yep, quite a few. The main thing is not to be star-struck, just treat them as clients, it's a business relationship. If you get tongue-tied and clam up, everyone will feel awkward. The other thing is that the unknown singer of today could be the star of tomorrow, so you need to treat everyone with respect. I remember, right...\n",
            "Hi there. I have had a lot of people ask me how I wash my hair in space and I thought I would show you how I do it. Let's see, to get started these are the things I need: a bag of warm water, a little no-rinse shampoo, towel and my comb. What I like to do is start by just putting some hot water, squirting it onto my scalp, and I have a mirror here so I can kind of watch what I'm doing. Sometimes the water gets away from you and you try and catch as much as you can. And I just work the water up through to the ends of my hair. Then I take my no-rinse shampoo and squirt it also on the scalp, just a little bit and rub it in. Again kind of working it up to the ends and sometimes I'll actually take my comb to help work it all the way to the ends. And then I like to take my towel while I have the shampoo in there and just kind of work it because without standing under running water you kind of need to use the towel a little bit to help get some of the dirt out. I like to follow that by a little more water. It's called no-rinse shampoo but I think it's best if you use a little water with it. It actually feels kind of squeaky clean right now. Now I will take the dry part of my towel, we use towels for quite a while here since we have limited supplies. We use them wisely. There, I think that's pretty good and now as my hair dries as the water evaporates from my hair, it will become humidity in the air and then our air conditioning system will collect that into condensate and it won't be long and our water-processing system will turn that into drinking water. At the end I just do one final comb-through to make sure there are no snarls and snags, and while it dries I like to let it stay, stay free. I don't put it back in a ponytail while it's drying. And that is how I wash my hair in space on the International Space Station.\n",
            "Here in Bristol, there's a snake on the loose, but this is a snake with a difference. Behind me is a high-tech science facility at the cutting edge of British innovation and the snake? Well, it's a robot. This is a snake-arm robot created by OC Robotics. The arm can be guided to places where people can't or don't want to go so can be used where access is difficult or where there might be danger. It's being used in the aerospace, medicine, security and nuclear industries. Dr Rob Buckingham is the co-founder of OC Robotics. Rob, what exactly is the snake-arm robot? The snake-arm robot is a long, slender robot arm and it's designed to get into confined spaces where there's radiation, or underwater, or very small spaces. So this would be perfect for space exploration? We are talking to NASA about just that, so maintenance of satellites. There are now lots of satellites in space and also when it comes to going to Mars, again, it's all going to be robotised. Tim, how exactly does this hub work? So, it's really simple. A couple of monitors, one showing the on-board camera, one showing a virtual environment, a few computers controlling the system and then this games console controller. All right, I've used one of these before. This should be very easy. What do I have to do? Just forward, backwards...? Forwards, backwards, left, right with those, and we're good to go. This isn't worrying you at all...? No, absolutely, go ahead. Just go for it. Easy-peasy. Is it supposed to do that? Do you like the way I moved to the right there? Look at that. Oh, look, we can see ourselves in the background. So, that's from the on-board camera. Hello, Mum! Why do you think Britain leads the world when it comes to innovation? Well, I think it's because we're brought up to be quite creative and we're not scared of a challenge, and that's a powerful combination. Britain leads the way in high-tech innovations, including the high-profile world of Formula 1. Every part of a Formula 1 car has some input from Great Britain - from design to manufacture. And now McLaren have taken their Formula 1 technologies and put them into their first high-performance, low-emissions sports car: the MP4-12C. They've even built a factory that the Prime Minister himself opened. It gives me great pleasure to declare this incredible facility is open for business! Thank you very much indeed. The opening of the McLaren production centre by the Prime Minister is something that is so special and such an honour for the whole team that's been involved in developing this car and developing this production centre. The MP4-12C has an amazing innovation: the whole chassis is a carbon fibre composite. This leading design and production could pass down to even more affordable road cars. Rolls-Royce has been a motoring icon for over 100 years, and this is its home - the historic Goodwood Estate, famous for its links with motor sports. This impressive building is their headquarters and manufacturing plant. For the last decade, it's where they've been designing and making luxury cars. Rolls-Royce is unique in the way it brings together technical innovation and traditional craftsmanship. I'm here to test-drive the latest addition of the Rolls-Royce family; it's called the Ghost and it's the most powerful car they've ever built. Each Ghost goes through around 2,000 individual stages. It takes at least 20 days and around 60 people to create each car. There's plenty of hidden technology and each one of these is hand-built to order. Matt Smith is an apprentice. So, Matt, what makes the Ghost so unique? Well, the Ghost actually has our most powerful engine ever produced here at Rolls-Royce. It's a 6.6 litre V12 twin-turbo. We have a new suspension system that caters for cornering, acceleration, braking. We have a night vision system. We also have new sound systems within the car. We have active cruise control, and we also have a lane departure system. What makes Rolls-Royce so special? It's the handcraftsmanship. It's how long each car takes to assemble. It's how much detail goes into every single part of the car and it's also just the feel that the car gives you as a customer. So are you looking forward to helping design the next big car for Rolls-Royce? Well, yeah, we always look to improve our cars on customer feedback, and I would love to be a part of that in the future. Well, this is another dream come true, driving a Rolls-Royce Ghost. A quarter of a million pounds these things cost, and it is the height of luxury. The engine sounds really smooth and quiet and I'm really loving this.\n",
            "Welcome to today's Business4U podcast. The focus of this podcast is to think about innovation and why it's important, and also to look at different types and stages of innovation. By the end of it, you will hopefully have a better grasp of the topic of innovation and be able to better understand and drive innovation in both your working and personal lives. So, why is innovation important? Well, simply put, without innovation it would be difficult to make progress. Organisations and societies would stagnate. Innovation is what drives us forward. It's what forces us to compete in the business world. It's what leads to better products and services, and solutions to new and existing problems. From a business point of view, it's also something which is necessary for survival. Four key types of innovation are incremental, disruptive, architectural and radical. Incremental innovation involves innovating in increments, or small stages. Step by step. It focuses on existing markets and technologies and aims to make improvements and design changes to existing products and services. Disruptive innovation aims to bring new ideas, like technology or processes, to existing markets. In that sense, the innovations will disrupt the market and the companies currently serving that market. The first touchscreen smartphones disrupted the mobile phone industry because up to then, mobile phones had buttons and keypads. Architectural innovation involves taking successful ideas from one market or industry and applying them to a new or different market. This often happens when people think of other unconventional uses of existing technology. A good example of this can be seen in vacuum company Dyson's entry into the hand dryer and hairdryer market. Their advanced airflow technology from their vacuum cleaners was applied in reverse to machines that blow out air. In the case of these examples, it's personal hairdryers and hand dryers in public toilets. And finally, we come to radical innovation. This is where a completely new idea is created for a market that doesn't exist yet. It's often what we think of when we think of innovation and it often swallows up existing markets. For example, the birth and growth of digital and downloadable music has practically led to the death of music CDs, and even DVDs. Similarly, film and TV streaming services may lead to the demise of traditional TV within a few short years. Moving on from types of innovation, let's have a quick look at five key stages of innovation. The first stage is Idea generation. This is where you think of the initial idea and develop it into a more detailed proposal or plan. The next stage is Support. You need to check if you can get support for it, for example from senior leaders or stakeholders in your company. If you're innovating in your personal life, then the support you might need could be from friends or family. Do they think it's a good idea and do they think it would work? The third step is to Experiment and test out the idea. This could mean creating a sample or a prototype of it, if it's a product. Or if it's a service, you could test out a basic version of it. The fourth step is Evaluation. You need to assess how successful your experiments were and what chances of larger success your idea will have. And finally, you then need to actually Implement your idea. That's the fifth stage. So, there you have it. We've looked at four key types of innovation: incremental, disruptive, architectural and radical, and also five stages of successful innovation: firstly, idea generation. Then, get support. Next, experiment and test out the idea. The fourth stage is evaluation and finally implementation.\n",
            "Hello, and welcome to the toilet of the International Space Station. Let's say you're up here in ISS and you need to go to the restroom. You want to come to this cabin and the first thing you want to do is grab this piece of equipment and turn this rotor switch ninety degrees to the open position. What that does is it turns on a fan which creates a suction effect in this hose so that you can use this yellow element for your number one. For number two the principle is actually exactly the same... suction. We have a solid waste container here and on top of it is this err seat. And the solid waste container is connected via this hose to the same fan so that again the same suction in fact allows you to do your number two in weightlessness. I want to show you how it looks but since we don't want any bad smells to come out we're going to actually turn on the fan. It's going to be a little bit loud. Here we go. Now you can lift the lid. There is this erm... seat that sort of looks comfortable but you don't really sit in weightlessness so most of us actually prefer to lift this one as well and use directly the, the opening that goes into the bag. And in fact there is a bag in there. It looks like this and when we are done with our business we close the bag and we push it down into the solid waste container and then of course as a courtesy to the next person we put a new, fresh bag inside. The solid-waste container gets changed when it is full which is roughly every ten days for a crew of three people using it. This one, for example, was installed on the sixty-first day of this year. So probably roughly around day seventy-one we will have to change it again. Erm, but urine gets recycled. So from err... the pretty complicated hydraulic equipment that is behind here and makes the use of the toilet in space possible, the urine actually gets directly transferred to another piece of equipment which is here in the floor which is called UPA - Urine Processing Assembly - which is the first step into turning urine into potable water.\n",
            "If I asked you to describe a great leader, I'd be willing to bet certain traits come to mind someone charismatic, dynamic, inspiring, a confident public speaker. You're probably imagining a man too, but that's a bias we'll save for another talk! We tend to think of great leaders as people who naturally take to the stage, who draw other people to them by their sheer presence, who are extroverts. But history has also been transformed by people who don't fit these descriptions. People like Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi. These people would have described themselves as shy, quietly spoken as introverts. Of course we're drawn to extroverts. They're usually charming and persuasive, fun to be around. They're not quietly in the corner somewhere reading a book where we might not notice them. Introverts are mostly happy to let the extroverts take the attention; they'd rather not be in the spotlight, they'd rather finish that book. If they become leaders, it's not because they want to be the centre of attention, it's because they feel compelled to act. They lead not because they enjoy giving orders but because circumstances have put them in a position to make change. If they're the boss, they allow space for the ideas of others to grow because they're not trying to make their mark. An introvert sounds like a pretty good boss, right? You won't need to worry about them stealing your ideas or talking over you in a meeting. Some of our great creators are introverts too. People like the writer JK Rowling, the great thinker Darwin and the designer of the first Apple computer, Steve Wozniak. It turns out coming up with good ideas is easier when you're engaged in quiet, solo contemplation than when you're leading the cheerleading squad. Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with cheerleaders! Extroverts are great - some of my favourite people are extroverts. But why is the world so set up for extroverts and so hard for introverts? Why are we always encouraging our kids to speak up, join in, work as a team? Nowadays, most schools and most workplaces are set up with the extrovert in mind. Children no longer sit in rows in desks, they sit in groups of four or six, doing group projects. Even subjects like maths and creative writing are taught with an emphasis on group collaboration, even though most writers sit alone in front of their computer or typewriter, with nothing between them and the blank page. A kid who prefers to go off into a corner and work alone starts to look like a problem. What's wrong with Janie? Why isn't she joining in? Studies show teachers think extroverts make better students, even though introverts actually tend to get higher grades. We're telling our introverted kids something is wrong with them, that they need to be more sociable, more outgoing. We're giving them fewer opportunities for the quiet contemplation they need in order to produce the best work and be their best selves. And then at work we do the same. Most offices today are open plan, everyone working and creating noise in one big room, attending team-building workshops or group brainstorming sessions; the introverts' worst nightmares. The introverts at school are judged negatively by their teachers and when they reach the workplace, they're passed over for promotion into leadership positions. But introverts typically take fewer risks and make more careful decisions, and don't we need those traits too? I'm not saying let's get rid of extroverts and grab all those talkative, sociable performers at primary school and send them off to the library for four hours a day of solitude until they learn to tone it down. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying we're doing something like the opposite of that to introverts and we need to stop. We need to allow them space to be themselves and then we'll end up getting the most out of our extroverts and our introverts. Let's teach all our kids how to work with others and how to work on their own. Let's create space in offices and at conferences for people to work on their own when they want to and give them the opportunity to come together to share ideas. Let's give staff 'away days', where they go off into the woods, walk up a mountain or wherever, to work on something alone, as well as the 'team-building day' where everyone learns to dance salsa together. The future is complicated, with a lot of huge, complex problems to solve. Let's make sure we've got our best people working on those problems in the way that suits them best. And then we've got to make sure we listen to our extroverts and our introverts and everyone who sits somewhere in between on the scale. We're going to need all of them.\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Now, I have a question for you: is knitting and crocheting just for grannies? Now, the reason I want to ask this question is because I learned how to knit when I was five years old and I recently learned how to crochet as well, and since then I have been making scarves and pillows and teddy bears and crocheting flowers. But I realised that it's something that's only really becoming popular with young people nowadays. Knitting and crocheting used to be associated just with grannies, but actually at my university we have a knitting society and lots of students participate in that and practise knitting, as well as male students - it's not just a female thing to do. So why do people actually think that knitting is just something that your grandma does? Well, I have a theory. When you think of a grandma, what do you think of? Or, when you watch a film, how is the grandma shown in the film? She probably has grey hair, maybe tied up in a bun, some glasses, an apron, sitting in a rocking chair, knitting does that sound familiar? So, I think knitting is kind of like cooking or baking or cleaning. It's seen as something that is quite homely, something that you do at home, something that women do, traditionally. On top of that, knitting and crocheting also takes a lot of patience and time, especially when you're just starting out and you need to learn the different techniques and different stitch patterns and all that kind of stuff. So it makes sense that people think that grannies are the ones who do it the most, because if you're retired and you don't really have much to do, then you have a lot of free time to start knitting or crocheting. Although young people may have busier schedules - like going out with friends or working, studying, doing sports - give knitting a go, I would say, or crocheting, if you haven't already, because you can actually develop a lot of skills. It's not only good for helping you relax and giving you a clearer mental state, but you can also learn other skills like problem solving - you might drop a stitch and have to pick it back up. You also learn a lot of new techniques, so it is really good for working your brain as well as your hands and keeping those joints very active. I think knitting and crocheting can be for everyone and anyone. If you haven't given it a go, give it a go! There are lots of great online resources to help you start learning, if you haven't learned already, such as YouTube, for example - there are so many tutorials, and I actually taught myself how to crochet just using YouTube, and I'm actually impressed with all these little flowers and things that I've managed to make. But I want to hear what you guys have to say on the topic. Do you think that knitting and crocheting are just for grannies, or do you think that anyone can do it? Are young people in your country doing it, and have you ever tried doing it yourself? Let me know in the comments below. Thank you for tuning in for this video, and happy knitting and happy crocheting! See you guys in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "Hello, everybody. It's Molly here and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I'm going to be talking about learning to drive. I'm going to talk a little bit about the process of learning to drive in the UK and how it all works, and then I'm going to talk to you about my experiences because at the moment I'm actually in the middle of having driving lessons and I'm preparing to take my test in about a month's time, so it's something that's on my mind at the moment and I thought it would be interesting to share with you guys. So, first off: what is the process of learning to drive like in the UK? You can start driving in the UK when you're 17 years old, but before you do that you have to apply for your provisional driving licence. You can apply for your provisional driving licence when you're 15 years old and nine months, any time after that. I have mine here; it's a little card that's green and looks like this. Once you have your provisional driving licence, you're allowed to start driving on the roads, but there are some rules about this. You have to put 'L' plates on your car to show that you're a learner, and you have to be supervised, so that either means with a driving instructor that's qualified or you can go in the car with a family member or a friend or something like that, but they have to be over 21 and they have to have been driving for at least three years with their licence. Now, before you take your practical test, you have to have taken your theory test. The theory test is made up of two parts. There's a multiple choice section, which has lots of questions about the rules of the road and is based off of the Highway Code, which I have here, so it's stuff about road signs and speed limits and all kinds of things like that, which is important to know if you're going to be driving. The second part is a hazard perception test where you have to identify potential dangers that might occur when you're, when you're out driving on the roads. Once you've had enough driving lessons, enough practice, you can take your test. I have mine coming up in March, so hopefully - fingers crossed - all goes to plan and I will pass, but it is quite difficult to pass. Lots of people fail first time and have to retake it, which you can do - there's no limit on the amount of times, I don't think, that you can retake your driving test 'cos, obviously, it's very important that you're safe to drive on the roads. So that's the process of how you learn to drive in the UK, and now I want to talk to you a little bit about my experiences. So, when I was 17, 17 and a half, I started having driving lessons. I had lessons once a week for two hours after school, 'cos I was still at school at that point. And I really didn't like driving! I found it very stressful. I was terrible at it. I had a few lessons, maybe about ten or maybe even a few more, but then I just sort of gave up 'cos I was, like, it's not for me, I don't like driving. Yeah. But now I'm 21, so that's four years later, and because of my circumstances at the moment, I've been at home for two months with not much going on, so my parents suggested that I learn to drive. So, I started lessons again and this time it's going a lot better, which I'm really, really happy about. One thing that I think really helped was that this time I took my theory test before I did any of my lessons, and that really helped because I knew all the rules and I had, like, a grounding of the theory behind how you actually learn to drive. Another thing is that I really get on very well with my instructor. The lessons are very structured and he's really calm and relaxed, which I like when I'm in a stressful driving situation. And at the moment I've had about 20 hours of lessons. Today was the first day I went out practising with my dad as well. If you can find somebody to go in the car with you, that's just helpful because it's just good to get as much practice as you can before the test. The other reason why I think I've been so much more successful this time is because this time I have the motivation to actually want to learn, which is really important, I think. This brings me onto the final thing I want to talk about today, which is the pros and cons of learning to drive, because there are some disadvantages as well as advantages. One of the main disadvantages is the cost. Learning to drive is an expensive process. The theory test costs £23, I think, and the practical test costs £62, so just that alone is quite a bit of money. Driving lessons themselves can be quite expensive, and if you do learn to drive and you want to actually drive in a car, then you have to be insured and the insurance can be expensive. So, it's not the cheapest thing to learn to do. Obviously, driving a car overtaking public transport is not so good for the environment, so that's something to bear in mind, and if you live in a really big city with good public transport links, you don't necessarily need a car. But there are definitely good reasons to learn to drive. For a teenager or a young adult like me, it does give you independence. Instead of having to rely on my parents to drive me to places, I can drive myself. But the main reason why I want to drive is because it's a really useful skill, and I just don't know when I'm going to need it. I don't know where I'm going to live when I finish university. I don't know what kind of job I'm going to get. I don't want to not be able to go for an opportunity in life because I can't drive. I hope you enjoyed this video about learning to drive. It's quite an exciting thing to do, a bit scary at times but also an important thing and kind of a rite of passage. Fingers crossed I pass, and I might make another video for you nearer the time about the test and how that was, if, if that is something you guys would be interested in. And I'll see you in the next video!\n",
            "The works of George Orwell, C.S. Lewis and Tolkien have arguably more influence today than when they were first published. 1984, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings have also been turned into movies as has that other icon of British fiction: Harry Potter. This is Leadenhall Market, an old-fashioned Victorian market that's still popular today, and I've been told that if I walk over here, something rather magical will happen... because this is also the location of Diagon Alley from the Harry Potter films where wizards come shopping. Evanesco! The Harry Potter films were adapted from the children's novels of J.K. Rowling. She is a world-class leader in modern literature and one of the most successful authors of her generation. Over 450 million copies of the Harry Potter books have sold throughout the world. They've been translated into 72 different languages. Amanda Craig is a novelist and The Times critic for children's literature. Amanda, what impact has J.K. Rowling had on literature? I think above all, I think she's reminded the world that the British are great storytellers. She's made people in every country laugh, cry and sit on the edge of their seats. What about other British authors, then? Well, there are fantastic children's authors, like Philip Pullman, whose Dark Materials trilogy I'm sure will be familiar, and Anthony Horowitz, who reinvented the James Bond spy novel for teenagers, and for younger children, there's Cressida Cowell's How to Train your Dragon. All of these are fantastic stories. Why is Britain such a breeding ground for writing talent? Well, we've had over 200 years of practice at the novel and 600 years at the play. We've got people like Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare to draw upon, we've got the wonderful English language and I think we are full of curiosity about other people. We want to entertain them, we want to make them laugh, we want to make them feel shivers up their spine. We just love literature. Well, I'm excited about the classics and the future of modern British literature. They say there's a book in everyone and I feel so inspired, I'm going to start writing straight away. I just need a pen...\n",
            "I think that even up until just a few years ago we could never have imagined how our behaviour would change with regards to using mobiles and tablets. I know that I would find it incredibly difficult to live without my mobile. I'm constantly looking at my phone to see if I've got any new messages or updates, and checking my apps to see what's new. I wouldn't say that I post my life online, not like some people I know, but I do like to keep up with what people are up to — friends, family and even other people I know but maybe haven't seen for years, like old school friends, and check out photos of what they look like now, ha ha ha In a way, I think it's quite funny that we're always worrying about teenagers and young people becoming obsessed with online communication, but if you ask me we need to worry just as much about adults! At the office where I work, even when we have a break, nobody talks to each other unless they absolutely have to, which is a sorry state of affairs to say the least. Everyone's too busy checking their social networks and sending messages to have time to communicate face-to-face! People spend their lunchtime glued to their screens or barely glance up from their phones. Even during meetings people can't resist subtly checking their phone, and what really irritates me is when you are trying to talk to someone and they're more interested in looking at their phone than paying attention to what you're saying, even though you're right in front of them! Phubbing, I think it's called! I was listening to this discussion on the radio the other day talking about online communication and they were talking about FOMO or, what was it, Fear of Missing Out, which apparently is a kind of modern-day psychological syndrome which we're affected by because of our obsession with online communication. Basically, they were saying that the reason why people feel that they have to be connected 24/7 and communicate everything they're doing and keep up with everything that other people we know are doing is down to this fear of missing out. We're worried that everyone is having more fun than us or doing something more exciting than us. They also said that because we're spending more time communicating in the online world, we're losing the ability to enjoy the present. My generation is so different to my parents'. I mean, they're always telling me that they grew up in a world without mobiles and social networking and they managed fine. Hard to imagine how they arranged to meet their friends without a phone but they say they did! Uh... I had so many arguments with them while I was growing up, until they let me have my first smartphone. But they didn't let me have Snapchat or Instagram or anything like that! 'It's not the end of the world,' they'd say! They just didn't understand that that's the way people my age communicate with each other. Nobody actually talks on the phone any more. They have no idea how much I missed out on at school being the only one who didn't have Snapchat. Also, at school we had loads of talks and stuff on how to stay safe online and most of us knew that anything you post online was going to be there forever. For me, one of the best things about online communication is that you can stay in touch with everyone at the same time, all the time. You know exactly what's going on, when and where, so you never miss out on anything. I love the fact that you can update all your friends on what's going on in your life and they can respond immediately with a like or a comment, so you feel like you're together with people even though you might be completely alone sitting on a bus or at home. I share loads of photos, but I only post up my best edited shots. I hate it when people I know post photos of me not looking my best.\n",
            "Excuse me, I was just wondering. What time does the park close? Excuse me, mate, what time do you close? Either four or five the park closes. I used to play here when I was a child. Of course they kept it much nicer back then. Now it's just a bunch of waste. I don't suppose you could tell me when the park closes, could you? Oi, oi mate. Where's the toilets? Where? Look, have you got a map somewhere, a map of the park? Oh, thanks very much. You've been very helpful. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. I think someone's dropped this. Are you looking for someone? Mate, what time does the park shut? What's going on? It's only five o'clock. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. This is you. It's me. Hoi. The park's closed. Not until six it isn't! And just as well. Just look who I've found! Where'd you get that? In the supermarket. Didn't you read about it? They've been hiding these all over town. Now, where's my twenty grand? Congratulations! You're the winner of the Target Mobile Find the Fugitive promotion 2005. I just need to take some information and the money's yours. Oh lovely, thank you. You're welcome. You won't be seeing me here again.\n",
            "You know, I've probably spent two-thirds of my life thinking and working on snow and snowmaking projects around the world. Machine-made snow is like two-week-old natural snow, in that natural snow sometimes takes hours or days to form as it's going through the sky in small particles and it'll form those dendritic arms. There you go. We're forming that snow crystal in somewhere between 3 and 15 seconds. Our snow is more like a BB or a graupel and it doesn't have the dendritic arms, but even natural snow after it's compacted loses those arms. I'm a second-generation snowmaking person; my father had been a skier and started to see a need for snowmaking. People looking to stabilise their business and for some type of insurance and without snow they don't really have a business. Our company has been involved in the Winter Olympics for a long time now. We are quite proud of being associated with Sarajevo, Calgary, Salt Lake, Nagano, with Vancouver and now with Sochi. This was a bit unusual in that it was a system where there was no snowmaking - there was really no resort there. We were fortunate to get access to a couple of helicopters and we found a beautiful, pristine, clear, cold water source. The higher up the mountain you can find the water, the less energy it takes to pump and deliver it. Finding this river on a shelf where we could build a couple of lakes to store the water sort of anchored the snowmaking system solution. They have a snowmaking capacity of 12,000 gallons a minute and they have over 400 of our snowmaking machines and they are all fully automated. They communicate via fibre optic or via radio modems and it's a very big, complicated, high-energy-using system, but very efficient and very effective for the size of it. There's some concern about what's going to happen with the weather there. It can be a bit marginal of a climate. Fortunately the cold weather has set up across the northern hemisphere and they are off to a very good snowmaking start. The only thing that really cancels an event per day might be fog or visibility where the athletes can't see where they are going and they're used to that. Snowmaking involves a lot of water, compressed air mixing in a small nozzle with water droplets, creates what we call 'ice seeds' and those ice seeds will then nucleate the bulk water blowing it out and then the cold environment freezes those small water droplets. Most of the snowmaking water sources that we use are groundwater from wells or they're surface water from rivers or lakes, and they are generally very clean and very pristine so in general most people can go ahead and eat the machine-made snow just like they'd eat the natural snow!\n",
            "Good afternoon and welcome to 'Book Corner'. Our first review today is of an unusual book by Charles Foster which is a combination of nature writing, biology, philosophy, personal memoir it's not very definable, but it's already being described as a modern classic. Jon, tell us about the book you've been reading. You're quite right, it's not very easy to define. The title is Being a Beast and the book is about the author's attempts to be a beast, that is, to live as an animal, or rather as several animals: a badger, an otter, a fox, a red deer and a bird. He says he wanted to really know what life was like for these animals and so he did the conventional research, the reading and so on. Then he actually tried to live in the same way as them, as far as possible. For example, when he's being a badger, he goes to live in a hole in the ground and crawls around a wood, learning to identify different trees by their smell. He even experiments with eating earthworms. Eighty-five per cent of a badger's diet is made up of earthworms - did you know that? Ugh! I didn't know that. He took one of his children with him, didn't he? Yes, his eight-year-old son, Tom. Foster says that children make better animals than adults in many ways - they use their senses to understand the world more, and they think in a much less abstract way than adults. Another reason why he took his son is that badgers are social creatures and would never live alone. He says that Tom adapted quickly to being a badger, learning to smell mice, hear tiny forest sounds and get around on four feet. How did Foster tackle being the other animals? In the same kind of way. As an otter, he spent a lot of time in the rivers and lakes and the sea, as an otter would - alone this time, since otters are solitary. The otter's big problem is that it has to spend all its time hunting for food in order to survive, and that feeling of desperation was hard to recreate, but he did catch live fish in his mouth. To try to live as a red deer, Foster went to the north of Scotland. He nearly died from exposure to the cold out on the mountains, and he asked a local to set his dogs on him so that he could experience being hunted. What happened? The dogs realised that he wasn't a red deer! That episode left Foster feeling that he had failed to get close to understanding the animal, but he had much more success as a fox. In London, he tried to forage for waste food, as an urban fox would. There's one very funny part where he's trying to sleep on the ground like a fox, and a police officer tries to move him on. He tries to explain that he's trying to be a fox... and gets arrested, I suppose! Almost! In London he had the kind of animal encounter that he'd been hoping for: a fox looked him in the eye and he felt some kind of relationship was being established, animal to animal. He felt he had got close to understanding foxes - he had great respect for their ability to survive and thrive in the city. The end of the book is about swifts, those amazing birds which travel thousands of miles between continents every year. It must be hard for a human to live like a swift. Absolutely! Foster can't fly! The nearest he can get to the birds is by standing in a tree and trying to catch insects. But this section has a lot of fascinating facts about swifts, and about other animals. In fact the whole book is very witty and engaging. It asks lots of important questions about what it means to be human and animal, and provides quite a few possible answers. I really recommend this to anyone with any interest in animals, or in humans, in fact. Although it contains some scientific detail, it's a very good read, by the way. Very entertaining. Well, I'll certainly look out for that book, Jon. Thanks. Now, our next book is about something completely different\n",
            "The average American produces 4.3lbs of trash a day. That's almost sixteen hundred pounds a year but if we took some simple steps we could go off the trash grid and minimise thousands of pounds of waste into just a single jar! Going off Grid So, this is my trash jar. Two years of trash in this tiny little jar. Yep! That's crazy. I mean I probably produce twenty times this much in a day. Yep. This is everything basically that I couldn't compost or couldn't recycle or couldn't figure out what to do with. Where did you get this idea to become zero waste? Erm, it kind of all started when I was a senior and in NYU and I was starting environmental studies. And one day after class I went home to make dinner and I opened my fridge and I saw that everything in there was packaged in plastic and I felt such a hypocrite. We're supposed to be saving the planet and here you are making all of this trash. I feel like it's really important to live your values and my values are having a really low environmental impact. I have to live like I want that. And so that's why I've decided to change my lifestyle. What was the easiest part about reducing your waste? I think it was just like seeing that I didn't have to do that much to produce very little waste and by composting and buying in bulk I essentially eliminated eighty per cent of my waste. Buying package-free means needing to have containers to buy things that you can't hold with your hands. For instance I buy bulk olive oil, I bring a mason jar to fill it up. I'll pick up some beer from a local shop that sells it in growlers that are actually reusable so that's like a totally waste-free way to drink. I imagine you get asked a lot of questions about 'how do you do this?' I'm curious about a few things OK. I'm going to throw out a few things too. Sure! Plastic toothbrushes? I use a compostable bamboo toothbrush. Sponges? I use a compostable dish brush. Paper towels? Cotton napkins. Plastic cookware? Wooden or stainless steel utensils. Cotton balls? Reusable cotton rounds. Drier sheets? Drier balls that I make myself. What about shampoo? Bulk castrol soap. Make-up? Organic vegan make-up in recyclable packaging. Feminine products? Menstrual cup. Gift wrap? Why? OK, so you are going to teach me how to make toothpaste. Yes! What do I do? So we are going to mix two tablespoons of organic coconut oil and then a tablespoon of baking soda and then about twenty drops of the organic peppermint oil. So this is how you make your toothpaste? Ah hem! Let me see your teeth! They look very nice! Eh yeah! What does your dentist think about this? They haven't gotten mad at me yet so...! Ha ha! So, I'll just take this spoon and scoop it onto my toothbrush. Hee hee. It's not bad, actually it's kinda salty! Yeah! That's the baking soda. Yeah, my teeth really do feel cleaner so Yeah thank you. So do you have any garbage cans in your home here? No, I don't have any garbage cans in my home. Because you don't have any garbage? Exactly! It really does compel me to want to try to reduce my waste so what tips would you give me or somebody else that wants to do that as well? Yeah, I would suggest, you know, look in your garbage can and see what your garbage is and until you do that you don't really know what you're reducing, right? Step 2. Using a reusable bag instead of plastic or paper bag. Just like, easy one-time changes and then the last one would be to actually make your products yourself. So learn how to make toothpaste, learn how to make deodorant. It's a really fun thing to do. What is your ultimate goal? Before I lived my lifestyle I wonder why is there all this trash, and why is that OK and we have to find the solutions before it gets out of control. I've never told anyone, 'Oh you should live this lifestyle' or 'You have to live this way'. Erm, I kind of live my lifestyle and put it out there and see what happens.\n",
            "Hello, everyone! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Now, in today's video I wanted us to discuss revision and studying generally. How do you study effectively? So, for those of you who don't know, I am currently at university, and exams are just around the corner. So, this is something that is very, very important to me right now and it's something I hope will be useful for all of you, no matter what level of education you're in, formal or informal. So, I wanted to share some of my tips that have really helped me to get through this rough period. So, the first thing that has helped me immensely this year is writing down my daily goals. Now, the way I do this is by writing my five study-related goals for the day on my whiteboard. I think it's important to limit it to a maximum of five because there are only so many hours in the day and if you write too much, you might get overwhelmed. I personally like using a whiteboard because I like the satisfaction of just rubbing out my goal once I've achieved it, but you can easily do this with a jotter, with a diary, a planner or even on a scrap piece of paper. I think it's important, though, to be able to visualise your goals, so you know what you're doing and to make sure that you're on track. My second tip would be to work out whether you're more productive in the morning or in the evening, or even night-time. So, for me, I am a morning person and I tend to work really well between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Any time after 5 p.m., my brain kind of shuts off. So, once you've figured out what period of day or night you work more productively, you want to figure out a cycle that works for you. So, what I mean by cycle is how often you study and how many breaks you take within that big chunk of time. So, for me, I work in one-hour cycles, and what that usually entails is forty-five to fifty minutes studying and then a ten- to fifteen-minute break, and I think it's important to not work continuously throughout that big chunk of time because if you work without breaks, your brain is less likely to absorb the information that you're learning and it won't be as effective and you'll get tired a lot quicker. I actually recently went to a workshop that talked about how to deal with stress and anxiety, especially related to exams. And one of the things that we talked about in that workshop was what to do when you have a study break. Now, I'm guilty of this that when I have my ten-minute study break I tend to go on Facebook. But actually it's better if you stay away from social media because your brain has just processed all this information you're studying, and then it will be trying to process even more information, more images, if you go on social media platforms. And studies actually show that it takes twenty minutes more to get back into studying if you are on social media during those breaks. So, why don't you go for a walk instead and get some fresh air? So, that brings me onto my next tip: staying active and getting lots of fresh air. I know that when we're stressed about exams, it's pretty easy to side-track being active and doing sports, but it's really important. Another study that I actually recently read said that if you are active for at least an hour a day, your concentration levels increase a lot, so actually you'll be more productive because you're mentally and physically exercising yourself. Good morning, guys! It's early in Scotland and I've decided to wake up before starting my day of studying and to go for a run, hence I'm a bit out of breath. But I just wanted to show the view, because I've run to the beach and it is so beautiful. As well as being energised for the day, it's a really nice way to start the day when there's just a beautiful sunrise. So, my final tip is food, because obviously food is important. But it's especially important when we're studying. I don't think we realise how much energy we burn when we're studying, because mental tasks actually take up a lot of glucose. But, you don't need to worry about the science behind it. What's important to know is that you need to have foods or small snacks that help to keep your energy levels up. So, I find that nuts are a great snacking snack, if you're not allergic to them of course, but alternatives can be dried fruit, fresh fruit, even vegetables. I love snacking on carrots and celery, you know, some hummus Smoothies and juices are another good snack, and on that note, of course, make sure you're drinking lots of water and you're staying hydrated, because that's just good for your overall health anyway. So, guys, I hope this video has been useful. Please comment below. Leave your tips that help you to be effective and efficient when studying and hopefully you can help someone else out. I hope you're having a lovely day and good luck if you have any exams coming up and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye!\n",
            "Hi, guys! Welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. My name's Molly and in today's video I wanted to talk about my favourite musicals. Number one on my list is Hamilton. Now, if you watched my video where I went on a day trip to London a few months ago, you'll know that in January I was lucky enough to be able to go and see Hamilton, and it was absolutely incredible. Hamilton is a relatively new musical. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, who's sort of like the forgotten Founding Father of the United States, and the musical tells the story of his life, his political life, his family life, his romantic life, his friendship life all of these things, and it tells it through primarily rap and hip hop, although there's a huge variety of musical styles within Hamilton and that's what makes it so cool and unique. Now, I study history at university so I'm quite a history nerd, but you really don't have to be to get into Hamilton, and if you're even in the slightest bit intrigued, I really recommend that you listen to the soundtrack and see what you think. The second musical that I want to talk about is Rent. Rent is a musical that tells the story of a group of struggling artists living in New York City in the early 1990s, and it's set against the backdrop of the HIV/AIDS crisis. It's relatively old - it opened on Broadway in New York in 1996. The song 'Seasons Of Love' is a classic, so listen to that! And, yeah, there's a movie version. They also filmed the final Broadway performance of the original cast, and you can get that as well and that is a great thing to watch. Another musical that I love is Les Mis. I think it's the longest-running musical ever. I know in London it opened in 1985. It's based on the novel by Victor Hugo. The story is set in 19th-century France against the backdrop of the Revolution and the aftermath and the main character is Jean Valjean, who's a peasant who's been imprisoned for 19 years just for stealing a loaf of bread, and then the story starts when he escapes and breaks free and tries to start his new life. And there are so many great characters involved. It's a beautiful story, heartbreaking at times. There are so many iconic songs: 'I Dreamed A Dream', 'On My Own', 'Do You Hear The People Sing?' In 2012, they did a movie adaptation which is also really, really great, so I would highly recommend watching that. The next musical that I have is one that you probably won't have heard of. It's called Everybody's Talking About Jamie, and everybody should be talking about this musical! It's a new musical. It's British. It's based on a true story, and it follows Jamie New, a 16-year-old boy from a council estate in Sheffield, and he has this dream to be a drag queen, and he wants to go to his final school prom in a dress. And that's sort of the start, and it's just such a beautiful story. It's so uplifting and heart-warming and the title song, ' Don't Even Know It', is just so good. So, my fifth musical that I want to talk about is something a little bit different. It's called 36 Questions and it's actually a podcast musical. One kind of problem with musicals is that they're not always accessible. You might not live near a theatre where there are a lot of musicals, and often they're quite expensive. So, this one is fantastic because it's free. You can listen to it wherever you are. It tells the story of a couple that are having a lot of problems with their relationship, but they try to save and fix their relationship using 36 questions, which are these kind of famous questions that were designed and they're supposed to make two strangers fall in love. So, that's my list! There are so many other fantastic musicals out there. There are new ones, old ones. I hope you found this interesting and maybe it inspired you to check out some of the musicals that I talked about. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!\n",
            "Hi, everybody. It's Molly here, and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video, I wanted to talk about New Year's resolutions because 2017 is over, we are now entering 2018 and, for a lot of people, this is the time of year when they like to make goals and plan about the future. I'm one of those people and so today I wanted to share with you four of my New Year's resolutions for 2018. My first New Year's resolution is to do with exercise. I, personally, have never been somebody that's enjoyed exercise. Er, I go on a lot of walks, but apart from that I don't really do any regular exercise, and that's something that I would like to change. So, one thing that I want to try and do is to follow the podcast 'Couch to 5K', which is released by the NHS, and basically what that is is, it's a programme that takes you from absolutely beginner, no skills at all in running, to by the end of the programme being able to run five kilometres, which sounds amazing! I would love to be able to run five kilometres. My second New Year's resolution is to do with food, specifically with cooking. I used to be somebody who loved cooking. I cooked a lot. I really liked trying new things. I found cooking to be relaxing. For the past four months, I've been in Spain at university, which was amazing, but my cooking really wasn't. So, I really want to make an effort to try and cook more things. I want to cook healthy things. I want to cook, as much as possible, vegan and vegetarian things. And, yeah, I just want to try some new recipes and fall back in love with cooking. My third New Year's resolution is to do with Spanish. I'm studying history and Spanish at university and I'm currently on my year abroad, so from September until December I was in Spain studying at university, and in March I will be heading to Argentina to work for the British Council. So, obviously, through living in Spanish-speaking countries, my Spanish is going to improve, but I really want to take matters into my own hands and just try and do some more things in my day-to-day life that's gonna help me get better at Spanish. So, I want to watch more Spanish TV shows and films, I want to read more Spanish books, I want to listen to podcasts in Spanish, and one thing that I really want to do is I want to try and do some translation. While I was at university in Spain, I took a class which was an introduction to translation. I found this course super interesting, so what I want to do is to translate things that I'm interested in, so I'd like to pick articles that I find that are interesting, I want to translate bits of my favourite books and poems that I like, er, songs that I like and things like that. My fourth and final resolution is something that I'm actually already doing, because I think it's important to acknowledge the good things that you do, and, if they work, keep doing them. So that for me is journaling, specifically to document my year abroad. So, I've been keeping a journal for years and years and years and years now. I think maybe in 2012 or something I maybe started. So, I have loads and loads of notebooks like this. And what I do is I just... journal, just write down things that I want to remember. And I have been good at keeping up with this so far on my year abroad. And I really do want to continue with that because I think it will be something really, really cool that I can look back on in the future. So, yeah. There you have it. They are my four New Year's resolutions for 2018. Exercise, cooking, Spanish and journaling. Erm, I really hope I can keep up with them. Er, maybe I'll make a video later, at the end of 2017, of how, how they've gone. Who knows? That could be something that I do. Erm, but I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video. Bye!\n",
            "Hello, everyone. I'm gonna show you how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from the International Space Station. Every time we eat it's kinda fun; everything will float around if you don't manage it. So we have some tape to stick things on on our table here, as well as a bunch of Velcro. Right, so the first thing we need for a sandwich is a piece of bread. Well, up here, we don't have bread like you do on Earth but we have tortillas. So we use tortillas a lot for sandwiches, so that's what I'm gonna use for my peanut butter and jelly. I'm gonna stick that down on some tape here so it doesn't go floating away while I'm getting everything else ready. So I get my peanut butter out and even the lids on the peanut butter have a piece of Velcro on it so they don't go floating away. If I let it go, it will kind of just float there for a little while and then eventually the air conditioning system in here will take it away somewhere else. So I don't want to lose it, so I'm gonna stick it on the table. I'll scoop out some peanut butter for my sandwich. I gotta stick this somewhere otherwise it just goes floating away too, but just for now if it's just a few seconds like this, I can just leave it and let it float. I spread the peanut butter on my sandwich, onto the tortilla, and then I get my jelly ready. There's a lot of things you've got to think about and manage while you're, while you're eating up here. And you just spread the jelly on the sandwich. That, as well, needs to get attached to the table. So there's my peanut butter and jelly tortilla or sandwich. From up here I'll just kinda close it up. And enjoy! See if you guys can enjoy as it's coming to you...\n",

They don't need to huddle together every winter for protection against the bitter cold, because these little fellows can do something no other penguins can Isn't that amazing?!

            "For years, women in Cambodia have struggled to make ends meet. Unexpected storms often destroyed their crops and when they did have crops to sell they didn't know how much to sell them for. Oxfam is giving mobile phones to women in remote villages in Cambodia and sending them text messages about the latest weather information and crop prices. The women are then able to share this information with others, talk to traders and barter for better profits by making a simple phone call.Chum Kor: The text messages are really important. They help me plan which crop to harvest and when - which increases my overall productivity. My community has been transformed. We are now more confident, and more organised. Before the phones, we did not even have enough food to eat. Now we have food and money enough to save. I am really proud of myself because I have the money to send my daughter to school. She will have a better education than I have had. Help mothers lift lives for good.\n",
            "If someone asked you to think of a magnificent hunter, chances are a lion's image would pop into your head. They have virtually no predators. The earth is their buffet table. Well, with at least one exception. This African-crested porcupine is surrounded by young lion cubs. The adults are too smart to fool around with this small beast. Those quills may be modified hairs, but they are needle sharp, strong and there are plenty of them! What the adults know is that porcupine needles can actually pierce the flesh of lion, and these wounds could even kill it. Nevertheless, a porcupine is a juicy delicacy. And these curious cubs look for a way to get a paw under it, flip it and attack. But, the prickly porcupine fends off the cubs and, eventually, good sense wins out over hunger. The victorious porcupine moves off. Yeah, king of the jungle - big deal. This porcupine has to walk through a pride of adult lions. They're interested, but once again, those quills give the porcupine the equivalent of an impenetrable missile defence shield. This pride of lions doesn't have much to be proud about today.\n",
            "My name's David. I'm going to tell you all about my best mate, Neil. I met Neil at nursery school. He was totally different from all the other kids in my class. He wasn't boring, or a mummy's boy. I liked him straight away. Now now, Neil, calm down. Now, now. Neil did have a bit of a bad temper, but both my mum and my teacher said, 'It's part of his condition', whatever that meant. My mum even called him 'special' once. Special to me - my best mate. Oi! When we started school, me and Neil were put in the same class. It caused a lot of trouble for my teacher, because Neil kept running around when she was trying to teach us something. He made the class a better place to be in. Hi, Neil!Neil: Hi.Girls: Are you coming to the park later?Neil: Yeah.Girls: Are you coming to the park later to play football? Are yous coming to the park?Boys: Yeah.Neil: I'll see yous later then, right? Where've you been? Once I got blamed for something I never did. David! And got taken to the headmaster. And got told off. And had to sit in the corner of the class for a whole lesson. Neil said he was going to sit with me, and he did. But the teacher got mad, and told him to move back to his seat. He still stayed with me, and got into lots of trouble. That's what you call a best mate. All through junior school me and Neil were always together. But Neil's temper to the other kids and the teachers got worse. Look, David's in trouble for his own reasons. You don't need to go and get involved. Come on, come and sit down. Neil, I don't understand why you're doing this, what's what's the problem? When we were going to secondary school, Neil said I probably wouldn't want to know him when we got there. I'm just saying, we're not going to be mates forever, you know. Because lots of kids go and meet new mates. And you'll make new mates, in a new school. And I thought that'd never happen, ever. We both went to our new school. And after being there for a bit, they put Neil in a special part of the school, to help him concentrate better, which meant I hardly ever got to hang around with him any more. I did make lots of new mates, but I hardly ever saw Neil. I wondered how Neil was getting on. Right then, Neil, let's see how you've been getting on with your reading, then mate. Very good. Very good. OK, well done, mate, keep it up. Then it was the day of the big race. Everyone would be there, including Neil. Oh my god... Oh my god, that is so sick...Chatting student 2: It's going to be proper. I can't, I can't, move any faster.Chatting student 1: Is it going to be like six miles or something?Chatting student 2: Or twenty! I'm just saying...Chatting student 1: Ah, here they come. When Neil came over to the field, they started to laugh and say nasty things about him. My mate, who had always been there for me. OK, runners, ready! On your marks get set go! Running just as fast as we canNo one can catch me but youI'll never leave you aloneBecause that's what best friends doSay la la la lala la la laSay la la la la lala la la la laCause you're my best mate, in the whole wide world...\n",
            "So have you heard about the Skipchen? No, I haven't. It is, where, you have food that's been, just gone into the skips and we take it out. OK, but it has been in the bin? For a short while, yeah. OK. But like, intercepted it on the way to the bin, which means it should have been in the bin and they've just taken it. What did you first think of the idea of it then? I thought it was a good idea a bit different yeah. But would you eat there? Probably not, no. Do you know what happens to the food we waste or like, how much we waste? I dunno. Or do you not think about that? No, not really. No? I just eat it and then if it goes to waste don't really think about it any more. What's the point in doin' it all? Like, does it get many people in the restaurant or is it always empty? I dunno. Erm, let's go and find out. Let's go find out! So, in the café we operate a completely pay as you feel erm system which means that people are free to pay whatever they see fit. We are really putting ourselves in the hands of the people but at the moment, people are paying and it does look as if we can succeed. As soon as we put a fixed price on something, then if we didn't sell it, we'd be creating waste ourselves. The food that we erm source in the Skipchen comes from lots of different places erm we have deals with local restaurants and cafés and bakeries, we've got deals with chain restaurants, we've got deals with other food charities. We also take food that has been wrongly discarded by supermarkets, so when supermarkets have thrown food away, we will take that food as well. There is a huge amount of food waste in the world. It's estimated that thirty to fifty per cent of the food we produce globally never makes it onto someone's plate. It gets wasted. So that's a good size meal per day per person that we're wasting in this country. The Skipchen is staffed entirely by volunteers. I myself am a volunteer and everyone else who is involved are volunteers. There's a big, big cohort of volunteers. Every day we have to come in and we have different stuff and sometimes we have, sometimes we have too much stuff and sometimes we have not enough so.. each like.. it's never simple. The type of people that erm eat at the Skipchen are really, really varied. Erm the whole ethos and concept behind the, the café is to create spaces where people from different walks of life can come and share a meal regardless of what they've got in their wallets. We had, like, a sausage stew, it was really tasty, like, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, like, really good, really good. The food's great! Yeah, really tasty and it tastes fresh as well. Yeah I'm a regular actually, I mean I work two minutes down the road so I come here daily. Ha, ha. It saves me a lot on food bills. What do I think about food waste? I think it's, like, criminal, like the amount that we as a public manage to waste. And initiatives like this, projects like this, should be rolled out all over the country. It's fantastic what they're doing here. Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow most likely. Ha, ha. So about the name, with the skip involved in the name, what yeah why did you put that? A lot of us who started this movement, have, you, know, we've lived out of skips for years and years. Erm now, now the food that's actually in the Skipchen, like, most of it doesn't come from skips cos we get it before it goes into the skips. So what do I say about my friends who are doubtful about this? I'd just tell them to, like, come down to have a chat and like we're like, really open and we'll, you know, talk to them about everything. They can, they don't necessarily have to eat the food straight away they can come and just talk to us about where it's from about like how we know it's safe and like about and kind of see everyone else that's eating here. But yeah it is difficult to change mindsets you know, because often, you know, the people that do come in they're already converted they already understand and the people that kind of are a bit more fearful about it they won't come in so, it is, it's really difficult you know, it's really difficult. If you come up with any, any ways of convincing your mates let me know cos that'd be great. Things I learned about the Skipchen, it's not all about erm the skip and how they get it from the skip it's more about how they make the food and how it's hygienic and how everything is done properly. And it's a nice place to be and I think it's a really good idea to start really. I learnt quite a lot about food waste in the process erm there's not there should be more done about it and there should be better laws about it.\n",
            "We saw the ad in the summer, in about July, I think, but we weren't really serious about moving then so we didn't even go and see it. It wasn't until November when they readvertised it that we got in touch with the agency and had a look. They'd put the price down since the summer too, I suppose because it had been empty so long, so that made it more affordable for us which helped us make up our minds. It was perfect - a bigger garden for the kids and enough space for an office. In winter it was lovely, very cosy, in fact, which is important to me as I really feel the cold, whereas my husband will open a window when it's minus temperatures outside! Anyway, in July when summer really started and we had that heatwave, we understood why no one had wanted to rent it over summer. It was boiling! All those lovely big windows that made the flat so light and open were like a greenhouse as soon as it got warmer. From about 8 in the morning until 7 in the evening, it was like living in a sauna! We couldn't stand being at home, and weekends were especially bad. No air conditioning, of course. If only we'd gone to see it when it was first advertised in July, we'd never have moved in! I always rent apartments when I go on holiday, rather than staying in hotels. Hotels are so impersonal, aren't they? This way you get to feel like you really live in the place you're visiting. It's the first time I've done it the other way round, though, and rented out my place but it seemed like a good way of making some extra money. The website is really easy to use and they only charge five per cent commission, which is lower than a lot of the other holiday rental sites. It's all about the photos and the reviews. Get the photos right and the place can look really upmarket and spacious, but you don't want to make it look too much better than it really is or you end up with a bad review. It's better to undersell and overdeliver so guests are pleasantly surprised and leave an extra positive review. So far, I'm averaging three stars because of one bad review that brought my average down from four and a half stars, but hopefully I'll get it back up during the busy season. Buying a house seems so far out of my reach it's almost impossible, as it is for loads of people my age these days. My parents always told me renting was throwing money away, but it was different in their day. Then people could afford to buy a house on a normal salary, but nowadays house prices are so high and no bank will look at you unless you've got a huge deposit. The problem with my dream of buying is that it's never going to come true. Not unless my parents help me out, but I've got two sisters and we're all in the same position. At least they've both got good jobs. Not good enough to buy a house, but at least they can afford to rent places of their own in nice areas. I just don't earn enough to rent around here. Even if I get promoted to manager, it'll be tough to find somewhere unless I share, and call me fussy, but there aren't that many people I want to share a bathroom and kitchen with. Some days I think I'll be stuck living with my parents forever - even renting is like a dream to me. At first our landlord was really helpful, couldn't do enough for us. You hear stories of nightmare landlords and we felt like we were really lucky, or so we thought anyway. He redecorated the whole place, from top to bottom, and let us keep all the bills in his name so we didn't have the bother of contacting all the companies ourselves. He even offered to come round and do the gardening as he knew we both worked long hours and might not have time. That's where the problems started now I look back. Then he'd pop round 'just to check everything's OK for you' once a month, then twice a month. Soon he was coming every week with some excuse or other. In the beginning we'd invite him in for tea, but it was only encouraging him, so when we realised, we'd try to have the conversation on the doorstep instead. It got so bad we pretended to be on our way out if we saw him coming up the path. We'd grab our coats and walk round the block until he'd gone. I don't know if he was just lonely or just didn't trust us not to ruin his precious house. In the end we gave our notice and found somewhere else. It's a shame because we really loved that house, but at least it's more peaceful in the new place.\n",
            "Hello and welcome to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. I'm Molly, and in today's video I wanted to give you seven tips for moving abroad. Moving abroad is a really, really exciting opportunity, but it can also be daunting and a bit overwhelming. I'm from the UK but I have now moved abroad twice to live in other countries. Last year I went to Spain, to Alcalá de Henares near Madrid, to study at the university there for four months. And more recently, a month ago I moved to Río Cuarto in Argentina, to work as an English language assistant for the British Council. Because of these two experiences, I feel like I know a bit about the process now of moving abroad, and I wanted to share some advice, some things that I have learned, with you guys. My first tip is to be organised. I can't stress enough how important organisation is! It's so important to make a note of any deadlines you might have, so any applications or any documents you need to submit. Make sure you know when you need to do all these important things. You should also save all your important emails and other documents that you might have in folders on your computer, and remember to back these up. And my most important piece of advice is: do not leave things until the last minute. Make sure you know well in advance when you're going to need to submit things, if you need to go to places, if anything needs signing or posting - make sure you are on top of your deadlines and do things as soon as you can to avoid stress in the long term. My second tip is to be proactive. If at any point in the process of organising yourself to move abroad you have a question or you're unsure about something, you need to find the relevant person and email them or, even better, give them a call. Under the umbrella of being proactive, I also think it's really important to try and reach out and utilise your networks. You should ask around and try and get in contact with people who have been through your experience. And, linked to that, if you can find any contacts in the country that you're going to, then that can be extremely helpful. If you can find somebody who can meet you at the airport, for example, or show you around your new city, or maybe even help you find accommodation, any of these things can really, really help you when you're moving to somewhere that you don't really have any familiarity with. My third tip is to be patient. Although, as I've said, it's a really good idea to be organised and be proactive, sometimes administration and paperwork can just take time and there's nothing you can really do about it. So, those are my first three pieces of advice: to be organised, to be proactive and to be patient. So those things are maybe more general. Now I want to talk about four more-specific areas that you're going to have to negotiate if you move abroad. And the first of these is entry requirements. It's really important to make sure that your passport, or whatever document that you're going to be travelling with, is valid and up to date. Depending on where you're going, you may need to apply for a visa. Important things to bear in mind with visas is that there is sometimes a cost, and I think most of the time you will need to travel to the embassy. So, I had to get a visa to come here to Argentina, and for that I had to go into London, and often times you'll have to go more than once to hand in your passport and your application and then to collect it later. The next thing I wanted to talk about is health. You should look online and visit your doctor four to six weeks in advance to see if there's any vaccinations you'll be needing for the place where you're going to go. If you're from Europe and you're travelling to another place in Europe, make sure to get a EHIC card - so that's a European Health Insurance Card. It's free to get, and you should definitely get one and take it with you, if you can, because it will help if you are ill or injured whilst you're abroad. Generally speaking, make sure to get insurance wherever you're going. If you're going to be abroad through some kind of programme, like a university placement, make sure to check to see whether your university is going to cover insurance for you or not and, if not, make sure to take out some of your own insurance. It's just the smart thing to do. Moving on, a really important topic: money. Moving abroad can be an expensive process, and preparing to manage your finances in another country can sometimes be a bit complicated. One thing you should definitely do is check around and see if there is any financial support available to you. So, scholarships or grants or anything like that. For example, I managed to get a Erasmus+ grant for my university placement in Spain, and this really helped me cover my living costs while I was there. Another thing to say on money is to make sure that you're aware of any hidden costs, so this might be things to do with flights or visas or vaccinations If you can, you should change up at least some of your money before you go, so you have enough cash to get you started when you move abroad. Also, make sure that you have enough savings in bank accounts that you can access if you need to. Finally on money, pre-pay travel cards, so, for example, Revolut, the Post Office Travel Money Card and the STA Travel ISIC CashFLEX card, can be really, really useful. You can load up these types of cards with any currency and then pay for things anywhere in the world, often with reasonable administrative fees. The final topic I wanted to talk about today is accommodation. Depending on where you're going and what you're doing, it may be best to find accommodation before you go, or it may be best to wait until you get there and then start looking. Regardless, the most important thing to do is to seek out the advice of people that have been and listen to what they say. You should think about the different kinds of living options that are available to you, so this might be studio apartments, student residences, shared flats, living with a host family, or maybe any other options. And think about which one of these fit with you and your lifestyle and your budget and all of that. Websites can be really useful - when I went to Spain, I found a shared flat on one of these websites a couple of weeks before I was moving and I signed for it in advance. Very important to say: do not sign for something unless you're absolutely sure, and often it is a very good idea to, if you can, see the place in person before you agree to something. If you decide to wait until you arrive and then look around, it's a good idea to book yourself a hostel or an Airbnb for a few days or weeks while you figure out what the options are and where you want to live. So, that's it! That's all I have for you today. I hope you found the seven tips, pieces of advice, useful and if you have any questions about moving abroad or you'd like me to make more videos of this sort in the future, please let me know in the comments below, and I will see you soon. Bye!\n",
            "London is the shopping capital of the world. Every year millions of overseas visitors shop here. But what makes shopping here so great? There's only one way to find out. I'm off to do some shopping - follow me! At Harrods Knightsbridge is famous for upmarket shopping. This is where the rich and famous come to buy their socks. And this is the one and only Harrods the ultimate in luxury. Even royalty shop here. If I'm lucky, I might see someone famous. If only they had it in my size. Lovely! Thank you! Done quite well there - what's next? Taxi! Harvey Nichols, please. At Harvey Nichols Harvey Nichols - or 'Harvey Nicks' for short - is a great place for designer fashion. Well, I had to buy couple of things what? At Hamleys The biggest toy shop in the world - now you're talking! So cute err it's not for me. Oxford Street London's Oxford Street is retail heaven. It's got over 2 kilometres of shops to choose from and, of course, Selfridges for shopping with style. Taxi! Could you drop all this off home for me, please? I'm off to explore a different sort of shopping in Britain. If you like shopping all under one roof, then there are big shopping centres all over Britain. The Olympic-sized shopping centre at Westfield, Stratford, is huge. With over 300 shops, it's one of the largest shopping centres in Europe. At Lock's Great shopping isn't just about big shops. Smaller shops can offer something special too. Tucked away in the heart of Piccadilly is a great shopping gem. Lock's sell that must-have in gentlemen's fashion: the hat! Lock's opened in London in 1679. Their hats can be seen across the world. They pride themselves on their personal service. Sue Simpson is a hat specialist. Hi, Sue.Sue: Oh, hi, Richard.Richard: Wow, a bowler hat. You don't see many of those these days, do you?Sue: Well, we don't call it a 'bowler' here at Lock's, we call it a 'coke hat' because it was invented in 1850 for Thomas Coke Richard: by this very shop.Sue: by this very shop and we still call it a 'coke' to this day.Richard: Ah, the classic top hat. When would I wear that?Sue: That's a beautiful silk top hat. You would wear that for a society wedding, or the time you see most of them is at Ascot, which is the famous race meeting in June.Richard: So what's your best-seller here at Lock's?Sue: Our best-seller would be a classic tweed cap or this trilby here, which is called a 'Voyager', and the novelty of this one Richard: is it folds up so you can pop it into your luggage.Sue: pop it into your luggage.Richard: Excellent. Is that a deerstalker?Sue: Similar to a deerstalker, but this is a country cap with a fastening that goes over the top. And this was invented originally for wearing in open-top cars, but now it's more commonly worn on the hills out shooting and this keeps the ears warm and stops it blowing away.Richard: I like it; I'll take this one.\n",
            "Small specialist shops can be found all over the country. The Lanes in Brighton are made up of a fabulous web of small streets with lots of quirky shops and boutiques. They're a great place to discover original fashion, furniture and accessories But a shopping spree doesn't have to involve visiting shops! British markets are really popular and sometimes in surprising places. This is Piccadilly Market at St James' Church in central London, and not many people know it's here. Photographer Simon Weinstock runs a stall here. Hi, Simon. Tell me about your stall. Well, I've been here 15 years on St James' Market. This is my most popular image; I do lots of other images. This is a London bus going round Piccadilly Circus with the old Underground sign, very iconic. I do the London Eye, I do the Houses of Parliament, terribly popular of course. So who are your customers? My customers come here from all over the world. I have Russians, lots of Americans, Chinese these days, Australians - you name it, they come here! Some of my work's gone to Outer Mongolia, believe it or not. And in your opinion, what makes Piccadilly Market so special? It's a very unique, small market. There's only about 40 stalls here. It's a very friendly market. Not that many people know about it - it's a hidden gem! And there are lots of stalls that you can only buy the product here, they're not available anywhere else in London, so that makes it very unusual. What do you like about shopping in London? I think, like, the variety of stuff and there's always something different, there's always something on the street, there's always something new to buy. I like about shopping in London the old shop, like in Covent Gardens, the old shop. I like the mixture of some expensive and some cheaper ones. I like. Well, I think it's just the variety of shops and places where you can go for shops. Britain is great for shopping. There's such variety, and there's something for everyone. The only trouble is - there's too much choice!\n",

            "Hi, guys! Welcome back to the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and YouTube channel. I don't know which platform you're watching this on, but today's video is going to be some of the most common British idioms. When you learn a new language and begin to speak with native people, you might realise that they use these unusual or strange expressions, which don't make sense literally but somehow still make sense! So, I wanted to share some of the most popular British idioms, so that if you're speaking with a British person and one of these pops up, you won't be completely confused. Also, learning idioms and using them correctly is a great way to make yourself seem more confident and natural when speaking a second language. So, if you can use some of these and keep them 'up your sleeve', then that will do wonders when you're speaking English with a native person, a native speaker or a mother tongue. So, without further ado, let's get started! Probably the first-ever idiom that I ever heard in my whole life has been 'a penny for your thoughts' and I remember hearing this when I was at primary school and not understanding what it meant. I was a bit confused as to whether someone was going to give me a penny to hear what I was thinking, but basically what it means is, it's a way to ask someone what they're thinking. You don't actually have to give them a penny, so don't worry! Next is saying that something costs 'an arm and a leg', and that might sound strange but what it basically means is that something is very expensive. For example, 'the new iPad costs an arm and a leg', 'my camera cost me an arm and a leg' it's a way to say that something is very expensive or valuable or just costs a lot generally. If any of you are sports players, you might be able to guess the next one. 'The ball is in your court.' Any ideas? It's basically a way of saying that you have all the power. 'The ball is in your court' means that you can make the next move. 'Beating around the bush' means that you're avoiding speaking about a discussion openly or you're speaking about something indirectly. So, if someone tells you or if you say to someone 'stop beating around the bush', it's a great way to say 'get to the point and stop dilly-dallying!', which is another of my favourite words. 'Dilly-dallying' means wasting time. 'The best thing since sliced bread' is a way of saying that there's a very good invention or idea. And I'm not sure who set the standard of sliced bread being the best invention, but there you go. It's a way to say that this is a really great idea. 'Oh, that's the best thing since sliced bread' - that's the best thing I've heard in a very long time. And last but not least, 'curiosity killed the cat'. This is one of my favourite ones because there's a lesson to be learned in this idiom as well, and that is that being too inquisitive can lead you to some unpleasant situations - not necessarily death, but there you go. It's basically a way to say 'mind your business, don't go snooping about'. That's all for today. Comment below and let me know if you have any other British or American English idioms that you know, and let me know if you do try out any of the ones I've mentioned. Erm, that's it. I hope you guys are having a wonderful day and I'll catch you later, alligator! Bye!\n",
            "Good afternoon. So we're fast approaching exam season and I can already see a lot of tired faces here in front of me. Well, today we are lucky enough to have Professor Manson from the University of Denton talk to us about how sleep can help us pass those all-important exams. So without any further ado, I'd like you to give a big round of applause and stay wide awake for Professor Manson. Good afternoon. Looking around this room now takes me back to when I was your age and life seemed to be a never-ending chain of exams and assignments. At that time, organisation was not my forte and too often I found myself up all hours of the night before an exam cramming every last piece of information I could in an attempt to remember something. Does that sound familiar to any of you? Can I just see a show of hands how many of you this term have had no more than 3 or 4 hours' sleep before an exam? OK, so that's a clear majority and it has to be said that last-minute revision can do wonders for the short-term memory, but what is, in fact, even more beneficial is a good night's sleep. So, I'd like to explain to you now, especially you all-night crammers, the link between sleep and memory and how a good night's kip can improve your exam results. Now, could everyone take a minute to work out, on average, how many hours' sleep they get every night. Can I see a show of hands for more than 10 hours? OK, none of you, how about between 8 and 10 hours? A handful of you. OK, so what about between 6 and 8 hours? Right, that's a popular option. And any of you fewer than 6 hours? Mmm, OK, so you're the guys we most need to worry about. According to the National Sleep Foundation in Washington, newborn babies need anything between 14 and 17 hours' sleep and this amount gradually decreases the older we get until as adults we need around 7 or 8 hours sleep, but, you'll be interested to know that the 14 to 17 age group should be aiming for 8 to 10 hours' sleep a night. So you can already see that most of us are not getting enough sleep, and this is something we need to think about. Sleep is essential. The human body simply can't survive without it. End of story. While we're asleep, the body checks that all our vital functions such as growth, circulatory systems and our immune system are in good working order. And while we're snoring away, our brains are very active restructuring information we've collected during the day and consolidating memories. So let me explain memory consolidation. Memory consolidation is what happens when information is moved from our short-term memory to our long-term memory with the help of a major part of the brain called the hippocampus. This is it, folks, this is the BIG moment when all of those facts and figures that you have crammed into your short-term memory are processed and consolidated in your long-term memory. However, as you're probably aware, we don't always remember everything. One reason we remember certain things better than others relates to the environment or conditions we were in when we originally made the memories. What experts have discovered is, the more emotions that are activated when we make a memory, the more likely we are to consolidate that memory. So, for example, the more interesting or fun you find a biology lesson, the more chance there is of you remembering information from it, OK, teachers? And not only that, we actually need to review information again and again after certain periods of time to help the consolidation process, which is why well-planned exam revision timetables are far more effective in the long term than short-term cramming the night before. And one reason why it's important to get enough hours of sleep is that this process of consolidation happens during certain stages of sleep. So you're probably aware that there are different stages of sleep. The initial stages of sleep are a much lighter type of sleep and it's not until we reach the later stages of deep sleep, what we call 'slow wave sleep' because the brain waves are much slower, that we consolidate our memories. These slow waves help move the information we have collected and stored in the hippocampus to our long-term memory. So what we have here is enough evidence to conclude that the best way to help you pass your exams is to learn the information in a fun, interesting way, review it regularly, and most importantly, get plenty of good-quality sleep. And before you all drift off into a peaceful slumber, I'd like you to ask any questions you might have. Thank you, Professor. OK, any questions?\n",
            "Ohh, that was glorious! You can see the tongue flickering on the air, it's drawn back into that classic 's' shape, which gives it the possibility to extend, to strike. Let's focus on the balloon. Oh wow! That is absolutely unbelievable. Well, it's a very, very short strike but you could see as the mouth opened, the sheath, that covered the fangs, being exposed. They are very, very long those fangs that really act like tiny stiletto daggers and they have just knifed into the balloon and, for a fraction of a second, the water is just hanging there in one place. If that was mammal prey, it would have carried it on in pumping the venom into its body, then it retreats and lets it go.\n",
            "Some people in America have said that when they're growing up, they often have a talk with their parents or older family members about what to do if you are stopped by the police. What types of things have you been taught to do? Don't make any sudden movements, because they might think that you're, like, reaching for a gun or something. Erm, and just like to be totally complicit with them. But that's the thing that, like, um, really got to me about the recent killings is that they were doing everything the cops asked them to and being totally respectful. But they were still killed for no reason. Having to have these types of conversations, it's not fair, it's not. But I think that it's really important that all, all black kids, or every kid in America should have these kinds of conversations because it's, it's the reality of the world that we live in. One time when I was, like, eight, I think, I was attacked by a kid who threw a rock at my head and then I screamed at him so he started crying. But then the people who were running the place grabbed me and started yelling at me, telling me I did something to him and things like that. I've also been called the 'n' word on multiple occasions. I was in kindergarten and kids would ask me why my skin was so dark. I remember coming home and asking my mom the same question 'cause I didn't understand. What can people do to help to make things more equal? You can spread awareness, you can go to protests, sign petitions... I think informing people and telling them this is a real issue that people are trying to fight every day. And to fix the law systems and make them more fair for people of colour. If things don't change, how do you see your life going as a young black person in America? I will continue to fight until I see change. You cannot put a price on a human life. And if people continue to die for no reason, I will continue to fight until that changes. Everybody has a voice, you can make a difference, and we need everybody to speak out to make a change.\n",
            "Britain is a sport-loving nation. It's the birthplace of some of the world's favourite sports including cricket, rugby and football, and it's the home of some of the world's most iconic sporting venues. From world-class football stadiums and Formula 1 circuits to the greatest arena of all, an Olympic village, Britain has it all. This is Silverstone Circuit, one of the world's most famous motor sport venues. Every year hundreds of thousands of fans come here to watch some of the most exciting motor racing events on the planet. Over the last 60 years this circuit has changed with the times and its most recent development is a new pit and paddock called the Silverstone Wing. Richard Phillips is the Managing Director of Silverstone. He oversees everything that takes place here. So what would you say to someone who's never been to a race before?Richard Phillips: I think you have got to come to Silverstone. We have the biggest and most knowledgeable crowd in the world, 320,000 people over the weekend of a Grand Prix. It's the biggest outdoor event in the country. All the great British names have driven here: Nigel Mansell, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, and me! I've always wanted to drive a Ferrari and what better place to do it than the home of British motor sport? Racing instructor Chris Ward is going to give me a high-speed driving lesson. So, right click into second. Just nice and steady to begin with. Let me just check we're all clear behind. Circuit's clear, so we're free to pull out onto the circuit. Squeeze the throttle, let's give it some power... Power, power, power! Down the left-hand side. Let the car rev a little bit more before you change gear. Into fifth. That's it. Keep the power going. And more power, and more power. What's it feel like being on the Grand Prix circuit at Silverstone? It's a fantastic feeling, it really is. Britain is mad about sport. From hockey to sailing, basketball to athletics, and grass court tennis is a national obsession. Rugby was invented here, as was cricket, and then exported round the world. London is also home to a tribute to a footballing legend... This is Bobby Moore, one of the all-time greatest footballers, and behind me is Wembley Stadium, one of the all-time greatest sporting venues and I'm about to get a peek behind closed doors. The stadium has recently undergone a huge makeover. It's home to the England National Football Team and the FA Cup Final. Wembley also hosts other sports like American football and big music concerts. And with 90,000 seats to choose from there's plenty of room for all the fans. This is where it all happens. The world's finest football players have given us some of history's greatest sporting moments on this very pitch. The stadium is one kilometre all the way round and above me stands a 133 metre tall steel arch which is also 315 metres across. It's the longest single piece of roof section in the world and you can see it on the other side of London. It also moves to allow light and air onto the pitch. This is the Press Conference Room. Up to 190 members of the media fill these seats after every game to ask the world's most famous football players the burning questions we all want to hear. Oh, it's my turn! But there's no time to stop, there's sport everywhere in Great Britain.\n",
            "There was always a lot of men outside the Institute, always. Penniless corner, my father always called it. They used to look so important and yet they were poor. It was all, all attached, you know, everything was attached, as you go in through the front door, there was a little office, always a noticeboard inside for things that was going on. Then on that side, on the right-hand side would be the big reading room that was the lightest room in the place. Then on the left-hand side then was another big room and they'd be playing dominoes or cards and there was all men I think that's what they lived for was their game of cards and reading the papers in the reading room. I mean, our dad never bought a paper, he'd always go up the 'Stute and read the paper. And then there'd be the library next door. The first time I ever really became aware of books was through the Institute. I remember discovering the library. I was fascinated by it. I suddenly walked in and there were all these books and I was told I could have any book I wanted, any time, free of charge because my father paid for it through the pit. But our families always were insistent that we better ourselves, education was very important. We bettered ourselves and we moved out. And you go down the stairs then and you'd be in the billiard hall. They were beautiful tables, the six tables that were there. And I remember how thrilled I was to have my own cue hanging up in the billiard room and they used to take an interest in the youngsters coming up. I know my son he was small, very small, he couldn't reach the table 'cause his nose wouldn't come level so Mr Howells used to stand him on a pop case and he cut down a billiard cue, didn't he, and made him a little one. Do you know, that's all we used to get out of him, can I go up and play snooker. And when there was a snooker match there, you could hear a pin drop. But it was a great cultural place to be cause the discussions raised about the table of course, I mean, weren't always about snooker. Not all about snooker, you remember listening in awe to these men, learned men discuss the affairs of the day but that's what the snooker hall was all about, yes. Then you go through there then into the toilet and you'd be in the picture house. It was beautiful, it had all the cherubs over the top, all the blue velvet curtains, oh it was lovely. We had a pianist in the picture house, oh yes, old Mrs Templeman used to wobble on the piano, playing you know, and there was no speaking, it would just come up from underneath like Pobla Condu, you know she'd make this rattling noise going along the piano, that was like the horses coming. Roy Rogers and all those pictures. Here comes then Phantom of the Opera and I thought the picture house was on fire. I did, and I shouted out 'the picture house is on fire', within five minutes the picture house was emptied! Our dad said 'trust you!' Frederic March! If Frederic Marsh was there, my mother would be there. My step-sister was all James Mason. Oh, I used to like all the ugly ones, George Raft and James Cagney, and the rougher the better. I didn't like love stories. Oh no, as long as it was blood and thunder, I was right. You know, everything went at once, they closed the pit and we thought the end of the world had come. And then they took the 'Stute. And I can hear old Harry Chapman shouting up in there, I can hear them arguing over the... somebody had put a wrong domino down and I said, do you know, I said, I can stand here now and I can see every one of those men sitting in their seats. And you know, I was crying, I was crying like the rain. I said it's just like coming in with a load of ghosts, just as if those old people have come back to walk this place.\n",
            "The sound of kids hanging out together. Or, at least, how it sounded a few years ago. Nowadays a group of, well, just about anyone - kids, teens, tweens, their parents - might sound a lot more like this Most of us spend hours a day with our heads bent over our smartphones. Research suggests teenagers spend as many as nine hours a day, while pre-teens spend up to six. I don't know, it's, like, the first thing I do in the morning, check in and see who's posted anything overnight. It's my alarm clock so I kind of have to look at it and then, you know, it's pretty hard not to scroll through. And it's not just teenagers and millennials, Generation X and even the Baby Boomers are almost as bad. I'm online most of the day for work and you'd think I'd be sick of screens by the time I get home, but most of my news comes through Facebook and I'm really into food so I'll hold my hands up to being one of those people who posts photos of their meals. But are we addicted to our phones and apps? And does it matter? Former Google and Facebook employees certainly think so. So they've set up a non-profit organisation, the Center for Humane Technology, to reverse the digital attention crisis and promote safe technology for children. Anyone who's seen queues round the block for the latest iPhone has to wonder what these people are thinking. You've literally got people sleeping in the street to get the newest device, probably not even talking to anyone else in the queue because they're on social media, taking selfies in the queue to post to Instagram. If that's not addiction, it's certainly obsession. A more formal definition of addiction describes it as a repeated involvement with an activity, despite the harm it causes. Someone with an addiction has cravings - that feeling that you haven't checked your phone for two minutes and can't relax until you get your hands on it again. They may have a lack of self-control and not realise their behaviour is causing problems - like texting while cycling or falling off a cliff taking a selfie. And, in case you're wondering, I read about both of those via the news app on my phone, which updates every couple of minutes with the latest stories definitely addicted. So the 'Truth about Tech' campaign by Common Sense Media and the Center for Humane Technology couldn't come fast enough for most of us. But it's children who are probably most at risk because of the effect tech addiction might be having on their brain development. Professor Mary Michaels of the Atlanta Future Tech Institute has been working with very young children. Mary, thanks for dropping by. What is your research telling us? Well, we know that screen time is affecting key aspects of healthy child development, like sleep, healthy eating and what psychologists call 'serve and return' moments, which are when parents respond to babies seeking assurance and connection by making eye contact, smiling or talking. All perfectly normal things we do and which help lay the foundations of babies' brains. It's much harder to engage with a baby normally if you're looking at your phone. Or, even worse, if parents give a crying child a phone to distract them instead of talking to them or hugging them, and that might lead to them failing to develop their ability to regulate their own emotions. And what about older children? Again, we know that teenagers who spend a lot of time on social media are 56 per cent more likely to report being unhappy and 27 per cent more likely to suffer depression. Teenagers are especially vulnerable because they're more sensitive to highs and lows anyway, so we're looking at, potentially, higher instances of suicide, schizophrenia, anxiety and addiction in teens which is exacerbated by dependence on technology. It sounds like a vicious circle. They're more likely to get addicted to smartphones and social media and that addiction itself makes them candidates for other addictions. Yes, that's right. Time to stage an intervention! Is there anything we can do to make tech less addictive? Setting devices to greyscale, which is basically black and white, might make them less appealing. Scrolling through a newsfeed of boring, washed-out photos just doesn't create the same rush as bright colours perhaps. And you can turn off the notifications that are constantly pulling you back in to check your phone. So is it...\n",
            "I switched to vegetarianism two years ago because I read an article about all the health benefits - best decision I've ever made. I feel so much healthier now. My skin is really good and my hair is much shinier. You have to be super-careful though that you still get all the nutrients you need in your diet. The main problem for me is that I'm the only vegetarian in the family, and the others want to eat meat and fish. So sometimes it's a bit of a pain for my mum, because she's the one who does most of the cooking. She usually cooks for the rest of the family, then throws something together quickly just for me. She says I should learn to cook for myself, but I've got so much homework at the moment... OK, I am a bit lazy about cooking. I'm going to have to get my act together or I'll be condemned to a diet of salads and omelettes, which I like, but if that's all you're eating, it's pretty boring. Did you know that there are about half a million vegans in the UK? That's people who don't eat any animal products at all. They reckon the number is growing because of teenagers on social media - like me! That's where I got links to videos which convinced me that it's the best option for animals, our planet and my health. I did a lot of research into what kinds of things to eat before I changed my diet. It's really easy to find vegans online who'll answer questions and give you advice. I've been given lots of useful tips, like you can eat chickpeas and spinach for iron — you know, to make up for the iron you'd get from meat in a conventional diet. I still really miss fried eggs and normal chocolate — oops, I mean non-vegan chocolate. My family have been supportive about the change, but I get teased a bit at school. Some people think that being a vegan is weird. Luckily I've got a lot of friends who tell them it's cool. I gave up eating meat a couple of years ago because at the time I was following a celebrity who was a veggie. Stupid reason, I know, but you see beautiful, glamorous people on Instagram and you want their lifestyle, so I became a vegetarian. I don't miss meat but I still eat fish sometimes, which sort of isn't really allowed. My main problem is that I'm not too keen on vegetables. My dad finds that hilarious. He's always going, 'How can you be a vegetarian if you don't like vegetables?' I do like chips, though, and tomato ketchup - they're made from vegetables, aren't they? I don't eat that much fruit either, apart from bananas. Anyway, but because my diet is a little on the unhealthy side, I take multivitamins every day. I also try and avoid rubbish like fizzy drinks and sweets. I don't think my diet's so bad. I feel pretty healthy. My whole family is vegetarian, so if you're brought up that way it seems perfectly normal. My parents are both good cooks and we had a very varied diet. We ate lots of international dishes: Italian, Indian, Middle Eastern and so on. I never really missed meat or fish, except when I went out with friends. When I was young I remember lots of birthday parties in hamburger places - that was a bit tricky! When you're young you never like being different. But later, quite a few people in my class at school became vegetarian, so I was no longer the odd one out. Anyway, now I've left home, I keep having lapses. I wouldn't admit it at first, but I have tried meat a couple of times and I'm getting to really like fish. I feel awful sometimes, but I love food and I want to experiment with everything. I haven't told my mum and dad - they'd be shocked! My main reason for becoming vegan was that I can't stand the way we treat animals - most farms are run in such an inhumane way. I refuse to support factory farming. The treatment of hens is horrific, not to mention what they do to cows. So now I don't eat any animal products - no meat, obviously, but no eggs, milk or cheese either. And I don't eat fish, of course. When I first started to be a vegan, I found I was getting tired all the time, so I went to see a nutritionist and she said I wasn't getting enough protein. Now I'm a lot more careful and I eat lots of different nuts and seeds, and pulses - you know, dried beans, chickpeas and lentils. It's a bit time-consuming, buying and cooking special things, but now I feel really good. My family think I'm a bit weird, but they're gradually coming round to my lentil and rice specials!\n",
            "Good morning, class. Morning, miss / Morning. So, today we're going to carry on with what we were talking about last class which are the advantages of doing sport on a regular basis. Let's start by seeing how much you remember about the benefits of sport. I'm going to ask you some questions and in your groups I'd like you to answer them. OK, so the first question is, can you remember three of the specific physical benefits sport offers to the human body that we discussed last class? OK, Group B. What do you think? Um, well we've got two. OK, let's hear them. We think that doing sport reduces high blood pressure and the chance of getting diabetes. Absolutely. OK does anyone have any other advantages? Yes, Group D? Yeah, sport is good for your bones. That's right. It strengthens our bones, particularly while we are still growing. OK, we also discussed that sport can be good for our minds too because of the chemicals that our brains release when we exercise. Can anyone remember the name of these chemicals and how they make us feel? Mmm, Group A? Are they called euphoria? Not exactly. Anyone else? OK, Group B again. Endorphins and they make you feel euphoric or really happy. That's right. So sport can help us feel happy and put us in a good mood because of these chemicals that are present in our bodies when we exercise. It also improves our capacity to concentrate, which is why doing PE at school can actually help you do better in exams. OK, so that was basically what we covered last week and what we're going to move on to today is thinking about whether it's better for us to take part in individual or team sports. So let's have a quick show of hands to see what you think. Those who think it's better for us to do individual sports put up your hands. OK, thank you. And now those who think it's better to do a team sport? OK. Well, there are certain advantages to both individual and team sports, but, in my opinion, the benefits of team sport do seem to outweigh those of individual sport. Can you shout out a couple of examples of individual sports? Yeah, like, karate or swimming? And tennis. Good. Well, you won't be surprised to hear that in order to succeed in individual sport we need to have a fair amount of self-discipline to motivate ourselves, which is easier said than done for some people. However, with regular practice, it may be easier to see progress. Also, it's worth pointing out that our individual successes and failures are completely down to the individual, no one else. OK, I'd like you to have a think in your groups about the possible advantages of doing sport as part of a team as opposed to by yourself. OK, Group C. What have you come up with? Well, we were saying that it might be, like, easier to be more motivated to actually do a sport if you're in a team because you, like, you don't want to let anyone down, so you, like, always turn up for sports practice, you know, so you are sort of more committed to doing the sport. That's a very good point. Yes, being a team member certainly helps people feel motivated and make an effort to turn up and play on a regular basis. Well done, Group C. Any other ideas? Group D? Err, because it's boring doing sport by yourself and it's more fun if you're with your mates. Absolutely! And the sense of being involved and belonging to a group is very positive for most people. Some experts actually believe that belonging to a group or a team makes us less likely to suffer from depression, as members develop positive bonds between them. And there are other benefits too. When you work as part of a team you are learning to work together and rely on each other. Everyone is responsible for the success of the team, so there's less pressure on an individual and consequently it's less stressful. And finally, can you think of any skills you develop when you work as part of a team? Group A? Well, you need communication skills to talk to everyone on the team. Yes, very good, Group A. Any more? Group C? Err could it be, like, negotiation skills? Yes, you need to communicate and negotiate with your fellow teammates. You also develop trust as you work together with others to achieve a common aim or goal, and all these skills are ones that come in handy in other areas of your life as well as in sport. So you can see that there are many all-round benefits to being in a team. However, perhaps, at the end of the day, the most important point is that you choose a sport you actually like, regardless of whether it's an individual or team sport.\n",
            "You will hear part of an interview with an expert on phobias. So what exactly is a phobia? Well, nearly everyone fears something, but when the fear becomes exaggerated and irrational, it's a phobia, which is the most common form of anxiety disorder. There are many types of what are known as specific or simple phobias. Common phobias include a fear of animals, particularly spiders, a fear of darkness or nyctophobia, or perhaps a fear of clowns, flying or a fear of public speaking. Now, you may not be keen on some of these things I've just mentioned, but most of us find a way to cope with the situation and don't let it interfere with our daily lives. However, if you have a phobia of one of these things, you may suffer from symptoms such as an increased heart rate, dizziness, excessive sweating or even a panic attack. You might end up going to extreme lengths to change your daily life so as not to come into contact with the thing or situation that causes your phobia. For example, imagine a friend of yours has a pet tarantula. If you're not a huge fan of spiders you may not enjoy spending time in his house, but most of us would put up with it. However, if you are an arachnophobia sufferer, you would probably refuse to visit him at home altogether. So you can see how phobias can have a real impact on our social relationships. And why do people suffer from phobias? Well, there are a couple of causes. If a child grows up with a parent who suffers from a phobia, the child is far more likely to develop the same irrational fear. Also, many phobias are actually triggered by a traumatic past event, often during childhood. So, perhaps an encounter with a vicious dog or falling into a swimming pool and nearly drowning as a child could feasibly develop into cynophobia, a fear of dogs, or aquaphobia, a fear of water. Listen to part of a radio programme in which someone is talking about why people like to feel scared. There are many of us out there who actually enjoy the sensation of feeling scared to death on a roller coaster or delight in sitting on the edge of your seat during a horror movie and, Jan, you can explain to us why this is the case. Yes, that's right. As you say, millions of us choose to put ourselves in situations where we consciously know we are going to feel scared, like going on rides at a theme park. The reaction we have when we put ourselves into these situations - you know, the rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms - is in part similar to that when we're faced with a real threat. What happens in those cases is that the body reacts to the danger with what we call a 'fight or flight' response. So, when the body detects real danger, it closes off any non-essential systems such as critical thought and reacts with automatic responses which enable us to either put up a fight or run away. We get a sudden huge rush of energy and at the same time the body is flooded with chemicals which protect us from feeling pain. The difference between a situation of real danger and being on a theme park ride is the context. So although we feel a certain sense of fear, we know deep down that the situation does not really pose a true threat and so this energy and lack of pain without any real danger allow us to experience a sense of euphoria or an adrenaline rush, which explains why we are able to scream and giggle in quick succession. You will hear some people talking about their fears and phobias. So, have you got any phobias, Liz? I'm not sure if I'd call it a phobia as such, but I absolutely hate needles and injections. Even the thought of them makes me feel queasy. When I have to have a blood test, I can't bring myself to watch and I feel faint and dizzy, and if I'm watching TV and there's a scene with someone injecting themselves, I can't watch. I think it started when I was little and I went to the doctor with my mum and my big sister. The doctor gave my sister an injection and I was watching... I started to feel faint and I passed out on the floor of the doctor's office. Oh no! Well, my greatest fear is clowns. There's actually an official name for it, coulrophobia, I think. I don't know what it is about them exactly, but they just freak me out, they're so weird. I've always hated them since I was a kid from birthday parties and the circus and things. They don't look at all happy to me even with a big painted smile. They look sad and scary, even a bit sinister. What about you, Ben? Are you scared of anything? No, course not! Well, apart from heights. That's true, I can't look out of the window past the fourth floor. And lifts OK, yeah, and lifts. I hate getting inside lifts. I'll always take the stairs if I can. I don't know, they just make me feel uneasy. And, well, I get really nervous if I ever have to speak in public. I start sweating and my mind just goes blank. It's so embarrassing... that's pretty normal, isn't it? Of course! Sure.\n",
            "I'd like to turn now to the object which is the main point of this talk: the helix. This is a fascinating mathematical object which touches many parts of our lives. Movement, the natural world, the manufactured world and our genetic make-up are all connected to the shape of the helix. A helix is a type of three-dimensional curve that goes around a central cylindrical shape in the form of a spiral, like a corkscrew or a spiral staircase. The helix is a very popular shape in nature because it is very compact. In fact, helices are sometimes referred to as 'nature's space saver'. In architecture too, the helix shape of a spiral staircase is an attractive option in buildings where space is very restricted. The most renowned type of helix is probably the double helix of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made of two helices that curve around each other, a bit like a twisted ladder. DNA contains the genetic information or 'code' that determines the development and functioning of all known living things. The helix shape is a very efficient way to store a long molecule like DNA in the limited space of a cell. There are different types of helices. Helices can twist clockwise, right-handed, or anti-clockwise, left-handed. An interesting experiment is to hold a clockwise helix, such as a corkscrew, up to a mirror. The clockwise helix appears to become counterclockwise. We can perceive examples of helices in many areas of our world. Spiral staircases, cables, screws and ropes can be right-handed or left-handed helices. A helix that goes around a cone is called a conical helix. Examples of conical helices are screws or the famous spiral ramp designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Helices are also prevalent in the natural world. The horns of certain animals, viruses, seashells and the structure of plants, flowers and leaves can all contain helices. The human umbilical cord is in fact a triple helix. With the discovery that the helix is the shape of the DNA molecule, it is not surprising that the helix is found in so many areas. It's one of the most natural shapes in nature. Let's turn our attention now to the mathematical description of the helix. You'll need a pen and paper for the next part of the talk as I am going to give you some variables to write down. Take your time to notice the different...\n",
            "Earlier on in today's lecture, I mentioned the importance of hand gestures and said that I'd touch on some of these, pardon the pun! Hand gestures are, of course, often culturally bound and can vary from group to group. But there are a few of them which, if not universal, are very common indeed around the world. I'd like to focus on the history of four gestures in particular: the salute, the thumbs up, the high five and the handshake. The salute, a gesture most associated with the military, may have originated in the 18th century. The Grenadier Guards, one of the oldest regiments of the British Army, used helmets in the form of cones. These were held in place by chinstraps. It was difficult to raise your helmet when greeting someone, so the soldiers simply touched their head with one short movement of the hand before quickly putting it back down again at their side. The thumbs-up gesture apparently goes back a lot further. It's widely believed that this gesture goes back to Roman times when gladiators fought in front of the emperor and eager crowds in the Colosseum. The fallen gladiator's fate was decided by the audience. If they felt he had fought well, they showed their approval with a thumbs-up gesture. The emperor would then confirm this and thereby would spare the gladiator's life. If the crowd gave a thumbs down, on the other hand, that meant execution. However, there are no reliable historical references to thumbs going either up or down in the Colosseum. It may be that if the crowd wanted to spare the gladiator's life, then they would actually cover up their thumb and keep it hidden. They would only extend their hand and thumb if they wanted the gladiator killed. This actually makes more sense, as the emperor could much more easily see what the crowd was indicating when looking out over a huge arena. The high-five hand gesture is almost universally used as a greeting or celebration. Many see its origins in baseball. Two US teams lay claim to inventing the high five: the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 or the Louisville Cardinals in 1978. It's quite likely that it was neither, and the gesture might have a much earlier origin again. It is very similar to a 1920s Jazz Age gesture known as the 'low five', or 'giving skin'. This gesture involved people slapping each other's lower hands, also in celebration. There are, in fact, numerous references to the low five in films of the era. Perhaps the high five is just an evolution of that gesture. The final gesture I'm going to mention today is the handshake. It dates back as a greeting at least as far as Ancient Greece. In the Acropolis Museum in Athens, the base of one of the columns shows goddess Hera shaking hands with Athena, the goddess of wisdom and courage. It's thought that shaking hands, rather than bowing or curtseying, showed both parties as equals. In 17th-century marriage portraits in Europe we find many examples of handshakes between husband and wife. Now, of course, the handshake has a multitude of uses: meeting, greeting, parting, offering congratulations, expressing gratitude or completing an agreement. In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good sportsmanship. In this way, the gesture has not strayed from its original meaning to convey trust, respect and equality.\n",
            "How have you ended up here? A long story. Would you like to tell me your story? Well... I got kicked out of my mum's house when I turned sixteen. Well, she actually kicked me out before my GCSEs, a couple of days before my first exam. Well, I was homeless at the age of fourteen. My mum kicked me out day after my birthday. I went to the council and they said that I had to go to the YM because I didn't have a child so they couldn't support me. Basically things just got a bit too much and last December we had a massive falling out. Not exactly the ideal upbringing of a child or teenager, but... I was living in a garage, in a, well in a car, in a garage. Car didn't work, had no engine. Slept in there for about two weeks. I was living in mine and my ex-boyfriend's car at the time, we had a Cavalier and my washing was going to my dad's ex girlfriend's, it was... she lived next door to an ex-boyfriend of mine. I lived down stables, in a caravan for a year. I've lived along the canal for seven months, in a tent. Well, I stayed at Stacey's on my birthday, when I got back Mum gave me a letter, cause we had another row and she was like, yeah, let's just hope you just get a place. So I grabbed some stuff and went down the council and showed them the letter and they stuck me in Acorn Lodge. It wasn't nice. It was like, I did turn to alcohol, ermm. Used to just think that was the best thing for me really because I had nothing. It was rough, it was horrible. I wouldn't ask for anybody to go through it. Not what I went through... I wouldn't ask that. 'Cause I used to look after the children all the time. I didn't look after myself 'cause I was looking after them. I was always run down. If my mum and her partner was in an argument I'd have to, like, take them out and like, try and do stuff with them, to distract them from the argument. It's always been to and from my dad's and my mum's house, and when my mum's kicked me out my dad wasn't able to look after me. But um, most of it's come from my stepdad, 'cause of his drug problems. Depending on, yeah, what sort of mood he's in at the time, kind of depends on how he reacts. I mean sometimes he'll just, yeah, get a bit mouthy and then walk off, sometimes he'll get violent. I've got a little boy, he's two and a half. I see him twice a week. Due to not being able to cope. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I don't want him or anything. Looking at me and my son six months ago was like looking at my mum with me. Now, and I thought to myself, do I keep going and let him have a horrible life and ruin his life or do I let him go with his dad, have a good life, let me sort myself out. You know, I've still got a long way to go. I've still got a long way to go and erm... then maybe in a couple of years' time or so, get, have him back or if not have shared responsibility. You know? In my opinion she had children too young so she took her youth into her adulthood and just carried on being childish. Had five children. 2007 she had us all taken off of her for being out drunk and on drugs and not believing the police that we was in police custody and from that day she just didn't care. We all went into care, and we all moved out of and it went from there really... I think because it hurt me and it did mess my head up quite a bit I'd say if I, like, didn't have any of that problem, I think I'd probably would of had a bit of a better life. It's like I can't blame myself for everything really. It's... if my family were better with me I think I would of been... a better person. Even if I'm not happy if I try to be happy and put it on, it makes me feel happy. I don't forget anything, but it goes to the back of my head. 'Cause I never used to be able to do that before I just used to always be negative unless it's about chocolate or something. I'm like, hmm... I'm bubbly and chirpy and that around people, and sometimes they don't see me in my room like, singing and crying but that's how I get it out, like, all my anger and that, 'cause I can't always go around hitting people or I will get into trouble, so I just sing really loudly with my music really loud and that's all right as everyone blasts their music anyway so they don't really hear me... and just like, scream and cry until my heart's, like, finished and I just want to asleep. I get angry, that's fair, I just, I do get angry and I've just got to apparently release it and find a way just to get through with life instead of, like, it's always going to be with me, but... so I know how to control it. My main goal for my future is not to turn out like my mum. I'm going to have a job, I'm going to get my own money and pay tax rather than spend other people's tax money. I would like to be working in a body repair shop. Cars is my passion, and I love cars... the only thing that brings a smile to my face. Starring on films, people know me worldwide, like, starring in horrors and comedies. For a better relationship with my brother, I suppose, 'cause, you know, all be I might go around saying I hate him to some people but at the end of the day, he is my brother. A good job, maybe my own little house, with so much of my mortgage paid off. Little car, little kitty, ha ha, just a little life basically. Err, my wish would be for my mum to get a little bit better and them to get a bigger house. Hopefully get back into racing or something, cause I used to ride for Philip Hobbs and, hopefully travel the world one day... so... I suppose, like, have a normal family, a normal mum and a normal dad, like, together still... and have like more of a family upbringing rather than just like, here, there and everywhere upbringing with all the drugs and violence and everything. If you'd asked me that wish three years ago, I'd have said I'd wish for a better life but to be honest with you that I wouldn't wanna wish for anything because my past is who, is what made me who I am today. So I wouldn't want to change anything, to tell you the truth. And that wish it just don't mean nothing for me. Right now I can do bus journeys on my own if I know that someone's going to be there at the other end to pick me up. Erm, you just, you just learn to cope with it, it's really hard but you just learn to cope with it. Try and find something that gives you that strength. Just keep trying, just never give up 'cause there will come a job around in the end, and a flat. You just, you get there in the end. But I'm glad me mum kinda kicked me out, because it kinda learnt me certain things to do with, like, life and like, your parents are always, like, wait until you get older and you'll realise what life's all about. And I kinda see what they're actually on about now. It's kinda, it has, it does hit you, it does hit you... I haven't done a lot to be honest... my life, my life starts now. Yeah, we did it! We did it in one day! We did it in one day! Brilliant! Yeah!\n",

            "Good morning, everybody. Today I'm going to talk about one of the most terrible wars of the twentieth century. Although it took place mainly in Europe, it involved countries from all over the world. I'm talking, of course, about the First World War, from 1914 to 1918, which resulted in the death of about ten million military personnel. Despite the enormous human cost, the war did have some positive consequences. In fact, it was precisely because of the nature and scale of the horrors of the battlefield that many important medical advances were made, as new equipment and techniques had to be developed quickly to cope with the huge number of injuries. As I said, the scale of the First World War was huge. New weapons were used that were designed to kill on an industrial scale, such as machine guns, tanks and poison gases. These produced brutal results: many deaths and about twice as many injuries. Those injured suffered very severe wounds and this pushed the medical establishment to build on recent discoveries and to come up with solutions for the new problems faced by doctors. I'm going to tell you about a few of these. You probably know that X-rays were discovered in 1895, and were developed for limited medical use in the following year. But their use became much more widespread during the war, when they helped detect fragments of bombs and bullets buried in tissue. They allowed doctors to extract these elements, which would otherwise have caused serious infections. Stretchers for carrying injured people had also been in use before the war, but the development of rescuing the wounded from the battlefield, by sending in stretcher-bearers to bring them back as quickly as possible, was completely new. The modern concept of a paramedic, who is able to apply first aid in the field, also comes from this time. Blood transfusion was in its early days at the time of the Great War. It was done person-to-person, that is, with a tube transferring blood from one person to another. This was extremely impractical and carried a very high risk. The rigours of the war demanded a better solution and by 1917 indirect transfusion had been developed. It was possible to store blood on ice for up to 26 days and deal much better with battle injuries. For many, this was the most significant medical breakthrough of the war. The war also saw advances in treating wounds which demanded that the patient be unconscious while undergoing procedures. In 1917 the anaesthetist Henry Boyle invented a machine which could provide a steady flow of oxygen, nitrous oxide and ether, and this provided the basis of all the anaesthesia machines that followed. Operations without pain - a wonderful innovation, I'm sure you'll agree. So the next time you have an X-ray, donate blood or undergo an operation, spare a thought for those doctors, nurses, researchers and patients back at the time of World War 1 - we owe them a lot!\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. Yes, you read the title right. This video is going to be about the lessons that I learned when I unfortunately dropped my phone down the toilet. I've let some time pass since then before making this video so I'm not as upset as I was when this first happened and that's why you can see I'm smiling, because I guess the whole point of this video is to look on the bright side of things and to see the positive in this situation. So, I thought I could do that by sharing with you some of the lessons that I've learned from this experience. So, my number-one lesson that I've learned from dropping my phone down the toilet is some very healthy and much-needed detachment from my phone. I think it's safe to say that people my age, perhaps slightly younger and older, are very much the technological generation. We're very much attached to our phones, to our laptops, to the TV, to our gaming consoles, you name it. So for me, dropping the phone, or my phone, down the toilet was actually a good way to take some time out and not be so attached to my phone, because after I dropped it down the toilet, as you can imagine, it didn't work, and as you can imagine, I had to save up for a new phone, so I didn't have a phone, or a fully functioning phone, for about two weeks. And what that meant is that I spent less time actually attached to technology. I went outside. I did things that I wouldn't usually do because I'd probably be on my phone, like, watching YouTube or browsing Facebook or whatever. I was one of those people who would literally have Facebook up as I was walking down the street, as I was sitting in class, you know. So it was a good lesson for me to take a breather away from my phone. The second lesson I learned is in line with the first one. That, basically, phones are just material things and sometimes material things break. Now, what I mean by this is basically that I learned that we get attached to material things a lot more than we really should. You know, phones at the end of the day are just blocks of minerals that help us communicate, sure, but they break down, and they're not forever, and that's like anything that's material, you know. Sometimes, when I was younger, I used to get really obsessed with trainers, in particular, and, like, always want the latest pair of trainers, but that just goes out of fashion or they get old, so I guess my point is that we shouldn't get so attached to material things. There's much bigger purposes in life, and life is much greater than just having the latest iPhone or the latest pair of shoes. So, the third lesson is that patience is a virtue. And I'm sure that this is a very much-needed lesson for many of us. It definitely is one that I had to really embrace because I basically searched up loads of home remedies to try and fix my phone situation and loads of them required you to wait twenty-four hours - even up to a week - to see if these home remedies had any effect. And I'm a very impatient person, so just the fact that I knew that I couldn't have my phone for a week really taught me how to be patient. Speaking of searching for home remedies on the internet, the fourth lesson that I learned is: don't believe everything you read on the internet. Some of the home remedies I came across were quite weird and strange and I'm not even sure if they're technically safe to do by yourself at home. And this doesn't just apply to mobile phones, but with everything. If you're researching for a homework project, for example, make sure you're using reliable sources and not just anyone's opinion, because anyone can write anything on the internet nowadays. It doesn't mean it's true. And the last and final lesson that I learned, which is the whole point of this video, is to look on the bright side of things. We will inevitably have situations or experiences in life which are negative or things just don't turn out your way, and you can either look at that and see that as a loss or as a failure, or you can look on the bright side of things and see what you can learn from that situation. I think our attitudes towards different experiences is ultimately what makes an experience good or bad, and you can definitely turn around a bad experience and make it good by, you know, sharing your lessons that you learned with people on the internet. So, I hope you've enjoyed this video. Please comment below. Let me know what good lessons you learned from a bad experience. Hopefully you guys never have to actually drop your phone in the toilet to learn these lessons. Hopefully I've learned this for all of us, but if you do, then come back to this video as a point of reference, and remember that there is the bright side of dropping your phone in water. The lessons I've really learned from this is not to bring your phone near water in the first place. That's probably a safe bet. But, anyway, I hope you're having a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye!\n",
            "Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another video for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. I'm so excited to be making this video today about the Black Panther film which recently came out. For those of you who do not know what the film's about or maybe haven't seen it yet, it basically follows the story of the Marvel comic, the 'Black Panther', where our Wakandan king, T'Challa, is both the superhero and the king of the movie. He possesses the power of the black panther. As with every superhero film, our hero for this film, T'Challa, has to fight off the evil guys who are basically trying to disrupt and destroy the world, creating these mass weapons out of a special metal called vibranium, which is only found in Wakanda. Wakanda itself is a fictional African country but it is, in many ways, very real as well. It uses a lot of aspects of different African cultures across the peninsula. Every aspect from the clothes that they wear, the languages they speak, the music, the dance, the rituals are taken from real-life African cultures. Black Panther was actually the first Marvel film I watched, and I really, really, really enjoyed it, so I would definitely recommend watching it if you haven't seen it already. And it actually made me go back and watch all the Marvel films, all the Marvel superhero films, and I actually realised by going back and watching all of them that Black Panther is actually quite different and special compared to the other Marvel films out there. As someone of African descent, this film is really important in terms of its representation of black people and also of Africa. This is one of the few Hollywood films in which we see black actresses and actors occupying the main roles. They're not the sidekicks, they're not the villains in this one, they are the hero of our story. And it doesn't just stop there. Almost the whole cast is made up of black actresses and actors, and even behind the scene we have an amazing team of black creators working on everything from special effects, make-up, hair, stage design, everything. So this really is a celebration of black talent. I think it's really important, especially for young people, to see people who look like them visibly occupying different roles and different spaces so that they too can be inspired and aspire to be like them and to be the best that they want to be in a certain role. And this isn't just limited to black people. It really goes out to all kind of different ethnic groups or minorities in public spaces, as well, so I think this film is really good for setting a good example of how we should allow many different people to take centre stage. As well as celebrating black people, as I said, this film also celebrates Africa. The portrayal we see of Africa is very different to the one that we unfortunately see nowadays, as a continent that is poor and helpless. Here we see another side of Africa, and a true side of Africa, which is filled with rich and vibrant colours and cultures, beautiful sunsets all of which do really exist in Africa today. In December I was just visiting The Gambia to see my family members who live there and it was amazing. The sunsets were amazing, the food was delicious and everyone was just happy. It literally was the smiling coast of West Africa. Even if you aren't African or black, I think you can still really appreciate just how special this film is. Black Panther is one of the very first non-white superheroes to take centre stage in films. But the film didn't come to life without its struggles. In 1992, actor and film director Wesley Snipes expressed his interest in making this Marvel comic into a film. However, this never became a reality. It's only 26 years later that we've seen this film brought to life in front of our eyes. So the wait has been really long! I literally could speak about the Black Panther for days because I love the film so much, so I'm going to cut the video short here, so you guys don't have to listen to me 'blabbling' on for any longer. But now I want to hear from you guys, so please comment below if you have watched the film - let me know what you think of it. And definitely get online and search up more interesting facts about the Black Panther because this film is so well put together and so much thought has gone into making it. So I hope this video is just the starter to tickle your interest and get you on the Black Panther fan wagon, I guess! Hope you're having a lovely day and I'll see you in the next one. Bye, guys.\n",
            "I think it's time, isn't it? Well, long overdue, for a fashion revolution. I'm very interested in, you know, kind of provenance of clothing, just caring about, you know, where your clothes are made is important and that's really the message behind fashion revolution. It's become very normal with food to care about where it's from and what we're eating and I think this should definitely translate to also what you're wearing. We trust that brands and high-street retailers are making clothes and fashion ethically and they're not always. There are things going on that shouldn't be. We want to encourage change and maybe vote with our feet a little bit, and sort of say we wanna know where our clothes come from and if you're not going to fix your supply chains or if you're not going to ensure that your clothes are made under ethical standards, then, you know, we're not going to buy them. We're here inviting people to come in and experience what ethical fashion really means and try to rebrand that concept as something that is fashionable, fun and easy to get involved with. I'm kinda joining in by encouraging people to do the inside-out thing which has been a huge success. I believe it's already trending on Twitter and then I'm down here at Designer Jumble, kind of doing what I do best which is sort of playing around with clothes and they've got such an amazing selection of stuff here. I think it's great to have another choice, especially in this environment of everything being new. This is so great to have things that are old and individual. I just really want people to look after their clothes and think about them and care for them. I think what you could do is get rid of your old clothes so somebody else could love them and they have a new life and be recycled. You can love a jumper or a top or a jacket and you can love it for, like, five, ten years, the rest of your life. It's not kind of so trend-driven. Don't just buy something and see it as disposable but just think about the work that went into it. It doesn't need to be so much kind of really, really, really quick pace which I think leads to the fact there are these awful conditions because the turn around and everything has just got to be pumped out. It's not about kind of suddenly stop buying anything new, I think it's about looking at fashion slightly differently. I hope that people will just shop more consciously and kind of think before they buy something. If you see something and do you want that, do you need that in your life? Like are you going to wear it? Is it worth it? Why is this so cheap? How did our clothes get so cheap? And start to question what's really going on. People tend to complain that clothes are too expensive and they want it as cheap as they can get it but that comes at a price. The Rana Plaza factory disaster that happened a year ago needs to stay in our memories. We need to start realising what that price is. The only way to do that really is by harnessing the vocal power of people who are shopping. If you're an existing customer of a high-street chain, you should start asking them questions, through Twitter, through Instagram, through Facebook or even in stores. What we are saying is start sending that question to the retailers that they shop from now, 'Who made my clothes?' Saying where is this made? Can you ensure that this was made under good working conditions? Just ask that question, the more they ask the question, the more the retailers will understand that they need to have answers to that question. I think the consumer is, erm, is the powerful one here. It's in their power to do something to change the way that fashion is not only perceived but how fashion polices itself. I think a lot of small steps could make a really, really huge change. I feel like our trust has been exploited and we need a day like today to tell them that we realise what's going on and that we're not happy about it. Those stores will listen to customers. It's bad business for them to ignore their consumer. I think they take for granted that we don't care, but we do.\n",
            "Hi guys! My name's Sophia and this video's for the British Council's LearnEnglish Teens website and their YouTube channel. In today's video I wanted to share my thoughts of why it's important to travel. Travelling is a passion of mine. I love meeting new people and exploring new cultures. Travelling is a great way to interact with a culture which might be completely different to your own, and there are so many great ways to do this. You can do this through eating food erm, exploring the arts, music, history, architecture or simply just walking through the streets. When you travel you expose yourself to the possibility of meeting different people who have a completely different outlook on life - and it's a great learning experience for both you and the other person because you can share and exchange your own ideas and opinions on a range of topics. For example, on one of my travels I met an Iranian philosopher and we talked about the nature of magic. A lot of his ideas were shaped by his Iranian background and Iranian philosophy and also Sufism, which is a mystical form of Islam. It was a really interesting discussion. The world we live in today is very global and international so I think it's very important to learn to see things from other people's perspective and also to challenge your own ideas. Travelling might just convince you to move to another country. Before I moved to Sicily I had travelled around the whole of Italy, the south and the north, and I absolutely fell in love with the culture and the language so I was inspired to learn the language and also to move here. And here I am now, living in Sicily. Travelling will make you a really good storyteller. When you get back home you'll have lots and lots of stories to tell your friends and family. Even if things don't go to plan, erm, on your travels, it will be funny to look back and laugh at those awkward or harsh moments. For example, I was travelling with a group of friends in Pisa and we took the wrong bus to get to the beach area, so we ended up being soaked in the rain and having to walk back. At the time it wasn't very fun, but now when I look back I laugh because we had soggy pizza and we were just eating and walking at the same time. Travelling is the realisation of home, and what that means is that when we travel we learn to appreciate our home more - and that's because, being away from home, we realise how much we miss our friends and our family and how much we miss the small things that perhaps we take for granted. It's all lovely travelling and it's great to explore new and exciting places, but it's also a lovely feeling to know that when you return home you're going to be returning to your dear ones and the things that you love about your home. Since I've been away from London, I've come to appreciate the little things that I used to take for granted, like our amazing transport - everything runs on time, everything runs well - so sometimes it takes being away from home to realise how much you absolutely love it. I hope you've enjoyed this video. Please comment below and let me know if you like travelling - and if you do, where you've been and where you would like to go in the future. I'll see you guys in my next one. Take care, bye-bye!\n",
            "We didn't know why the ocean was salty, how it got its chemistry, until fairly recently. Children would ask you, 'Why's the ocean salty?' We'd say, 'next question'. We thought in the early days that it was the rivers, the obvious culprits bringing all this stuff in but the chemistry of the world's oceans was not equal to the chemistry of the rivers coming in to it. We didn't know until 1979. We were driving along the East Pacific Rise and there was a black smoker in front of us. We call it a black smoker because it looks like black smoke but it's not. It's microcrystals of minerals so we discovered when we found the black smokers that the entire volume of the world's oceans is going inside the Earth and out every 6 to 8 million years and it's taking some of the chemicals it gets from rivers and it's trading them for new chemicals and this is occurring all the way along the mid-ocean ridge that stretches around the planet like the seam in a baseball, and there are tens of thousands of magma chambers down there and the waters get into them and that's how we get the chemistry of the world's ocean and we didn't know that!\n",
            "It's a story that put black robes back in fashion, made owls the world's coolest animal and made everyone obsessed with sticks and brooms. Of course, I'm talking about Harry Potter - and CBBC finally got a chance to visit the world that made wizarding utterly magical. For close to two decades now, JK Rowling's stories of Harry Potter and the rest of the wizarding world have dominated popular culture. Along the way they've amassed arguably the largest and most passionate fanbase in the world. CBBC Visits The Wizarding World started off with The Vamps giving us a recap of all the Harry Potter films in one minute. Voldemort kills Harry's parents  ... but Harry's a bit of a bad man so he doesn't actually die. He gets adopted by his auntie and uncle but then he gets a letter through that gives him the chance to go to Hogwarts. Hagrid comes and boots the door down and picks him up and goes, 'You're coming with me, mate.' I have quite a few bones to pick with that recap. What about the flying car, the Patronuses, the Dementors, the golden snitch, the Triwizard Tournament, Ron and Hermione? See - a minute is not enough! Anyway, we're not just here to talk about Harry Potter, because we have a new wizard to fall in love with - Newt Scamander, from JK Rowling's new film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Newt Scamander is a British, self-proclaimed magizoologist. A maga-what now? A magizoologist. A magawhoppalis? A magizoologist. A mega-hyped cheap florist?! A magizoologist. A mighty-fly con artist? Honestly, guys, I'm not hearing the difference. Moving on - Eddie Redmayne, who plays Newt Scamander, starts talking wands. Wands! When I first got cast they came with all these designs and possible ideas and... and we talked it through and I got super method on my wand. I always wondered what my wand would look like. How would my tastes and ideals influence the making of such an important instrument? Finally, a wand fit for a vlogger. Let's try this out. Lumos! Ahhh! Oww, ow, ow ow. Harry Potter truly is one of the biggest stories of all our generations and CBBC Visits The Wizarding World reminds us that it's only become this big because of us, the fans. So, let's hope that Fantastic Beasts proves itself to be just as magical with a magizoologist. Hey, guys, I said it right magizohopotis! Ahhh!\n",
            "I think it's really critical that we get more people worldwide and particularly in the United States into technical fields, and more women. We want to have people in the workplace that look like the world! And the world isn't just one gender. I think women just bring a very different perspective to technology - the way that they use products, their experiences, the way that it's built, the way that they think about the way other people are going to use the technology Uhm, people who aren't necessarily a part of the process - that's a loss for not just the rest of us who don't get that perspective, but also for them who don't get to shape the future that is going to come to exist. The problems of the future - these are human problems, they're not 'men problems'. We're going to need women to help solve those problems and we need them, uhm, to start now. It was an 'Introduction to Programming' class, and I walked into the class wearing a cheerleader uniform, and the teacher just cracked up. He thought it was the funniest thing to see a cheerleader in a programming class. That day, he also passed back the first test from that term. And he announced that the person with the highest grade in that class, with 100%, was me, the cheerleader. I kind of broke down the stereotype for him at that moment, where the idea that girls can't programme, that cheerleaders are stupid, that women shouldn't be in technology it just takes a moment like that to really change someone's mindset about where women belong in technology. We've learned over time that you can't build great products if you don't have a team that empathises with and understands the audience that the product is for. And with the internet, the audience is literally the planet now. As we grow to larger and larger audiences, y' know, the different perspectives everyone brings to the table become increasingly valuable to be part of the discussion when you're shaping what that product is going to look like. It's a product that's really about connecting and being social and, uhm, engaging with your friends and family, so I think it's, like, a very important product for women to be involved with making. The one piece of advice I would give a woman in technology is 'stick with it'. It is worth it to get to the end. It is very easy to look around you and feel intimidated because you don't know anything about the subject, and there aren't a lot of people who look like you, but the most important thing is to believe in yourself and to just not be afraid to do something that, er, you have no idea how to do. There's nothing you can't do if you believe you can do it. You know, it's easy to sit back and say, 'Oh, the stereotype is that women aren't good at engineering. They're not good at math and science', and to let yourself fall victim of that. But let that encourage you, let that push you forward and drive you to, y' know, fight the stereotype, break the stereotype.\n",
            "Welcome to Sawston College, my name's Geoff Peng. I transferred here just before the virus broke out. Apparently the Year 9 biology class was responsible for the outbreak. So here we have a lamb's heart. Make your incision down through the wall of the right atrium and ventricle, like so. Are you OK, sir? I'm here to tell you how to survive at Sawston, stay alive and get those all important GCSEs. There are five rules to keep your head at Sawston... quite literally. Rule 1 - Don't stand out. Charlie? Tiegan? Geoff? Ethan? Yes, Miss. It's gonna hurt! Rule 2 - Make sure you stay fit and agile and have a good pair of shoes on you. Zombie! Zombie! Hit the ropes. My trainers! They're not gripping! Rule 3 - Bring a packed lunch. If the virus doesn't kill you, the zombie school dinners will. Rule 4 - Stay out of trouble. If you get sent to the principal's office, you're never coming back. Sir, seriously, I'm not an idiot, I wouldn't break the rules like that. I did not bring my mobile phone into school... Please don't eat me! Rule 5 - No matter how much you like someone, never get emotionally attached. When it comes to zombies, stay your distance. OK, guys, so we really want to see that raw emotion OK, so just pull at those heart strings. My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to heal thy rough touch with a tender kiss. No! He's my leading man! It is a tragedy, sir! If you can follow my five rules, you may have a chance of surviving in this troubled, troubled world.\n",
            "Strolling along a deserted beach, I saw a bottle dusted with sand and found a message curled inside. An exciting moment! But messages in bottles are not new here. The earliest dates back to eighteen sixty when ships used them to keep those on land informed of their progress. None too reliable when your ship is sinking! But the local museum is launching a project using bottled messages, not just to promote the whereabouts of the islands and attract tourism. Islanders are being invited to include maps and information about the islands themselves. Bottles have been collected from local beaches and are, though not in the traditional sense, being recycled. Primarily and more ambitiously, the project is set to identify tidal movements. Not by science or satellite systems, but by hurling these bottles back into the sea! The hope is that people will reply to these messages through the more traditional postal system. Islanders will gain pen pals and new visitors, and the final whereabouts of the bottles will enable scientists to track their paths. And all this from bottles discarded on a beach!\n",
            "Today, we're talking to marine biologists Gina Kelso and Thomas Lundman, who you will recently have seen in their award-winning TV series about Antarctica. So, Thomas, what's it like to suddenly become a household name? Well, we're being interviewed for all sorts of publications and programmes since our television series about the wildlife in Antarctica won a major award. I'm often asked if I've always been interested in marine wildlife, and I find that hard to answer. What about you, Gina? That's an easy one for me, Thomas. I grew up on African shores, where my father worked for an international company. I could swim by the age of four, snorkel at five. I guess I was destined for marine biology because I've always been as happy in the water as on land. I remember a particular evening when I was about eleven. It was dusk and I was snorkelling, and I came across hundreds of stingrays entwined together. It was extraordinary; another world, and that was the moment that decided me. Although I later went to school in the middle of England, I'd lie awake at night dreaming of the ocean. Fortunately, I got in to university to do zoology and went on to do research in marine biology. And, like me, you've been in wildlife filmmaking for how long, about eight years now? Yeah, I knew it was what I wanted to do, but instead of following the normal route of joining a TV company as a researcher, I was lucky enough to be chosen to take part in that first wildlife programme we did together. Do you remember? Yeah, where we made the first ever live broadcast under the sea. The practice run was very funny. I had to dive into a swimming pool and give a running commentary on some plastic plants that had been borrowed from a studio to make it look more realistic. Fortunately, the programme itself was a success and so one thing led to another after that, and we both moved more into the production side. And it was tough making this latest series in Antarctica, wasn't it? Well, the series is introduced by a well-known naturalist, dressed in a thermal anorak with the hood drawn so tightly that you can only see his nose. And you get an idea of what conditions were like, but he was only the presenter - flown in to do his bit and flown back out again. We spent eight months there filming with a team of cameramen and researchers, living on a specially adapted boat. I didn't think I'd stand a chance of working on the programme, because I imagined they'd be looking for rugged types and I'm more the quiet academic. So I was quite taken aback when they asked me. We went for the spring and then returned the following spring, because the winter would've been too cold. Even then, on the Antarctic peninsula it can drop to minus fifteen degrees. We were involved mostly with the underwater scenes. It's a lot warmer in the sea, but we still had to wear extra-thick wetsuits and thermal underwear. The thing about living in that remote research community was I missed hanging out with my friends. But the Antarctic's a place of incredible beauty and even after working sixteen-hour days, there were still moments of peacefulness. But being with the animals for so long, we got to see things the other scientists hadn't. One guy's been studying fur seals for years - knows everything about them - but he's never seen them eat. He was thrilled when we were able to tell him about it. And if we'd had his input at the time, we would have realised the significance of what we'd seen and focused more on it. Absolutely. And the highlight of the trip was the day we entered a bay carved into huge glaciers to find around forty humpback whales feeding. It was very quiet, and then we heard a soft explosion. It was the noise of the whales' blowholes. What they do is dive down, and as they start to come up again they release air bubbles from their blowholes. Then they swim round each other, trapping the krill they eat in a curtain of bubbles. So it's an extraordinarily effective piece of teamwork that really increases their feeding efficiency. We filmed them for ten days because we wanted a shot of them as they finished eating. We waited and waited and then one day they just suddenly stopped. And that's,\n",
            "I knew I'd be short of money if I didn't work before going to university, so I decided not to jet around the globe, and found a job in the nearest town instead. I had to live in because of early shifts, and only realised on about day two it meant I couldn't keep up my tennis - which was a blow, because I was a very keen player. But I got over it in the end, which just goes to show nothing's that important. Anyway, I was having too much fun with the rest of the staff to fret about it - I wonder if they're all still there? The worst part of the job was when guests complained, which they frequently did! Well, I took a gap year because I thought I hadn't seen enough of the world. I considered doing an overland trek across the Sahara, or helping out somewhere as a volunteer. Then I found a remote village in Kenya where they needed my skills - they're all football-mad there - and a Nairobi businessman agreed to pay me a living wage. I settled in OK, although I never got the hang of the language, and that year gave me some serious thinking time. I realised I didn't want to complete my course back home, even though I'd already spent quite a lot of money and time on it. It's all good experience anyway. The whole thing was a disaster from start to finish. I'd had a sort of feeling it might turn out badly. We didn't have the right training or equipment, and because there was no office back-up, we couldn't get news forwarded to our families. And the leader - well, I wonder how experienced he really was. He couldn't speak the porters' language at all. You could say our pioneering spirit was crushed by the time we got back to base camp! On the other hand, we did bond as a group, and I see a couple of them regularly and have done ever since that time. So perhaps it wasn't all bad. I know some agencies will organise your gap year and sort out, say, working for a charity, but I'd much rather do what I did - just go off on the spur of the moment and see where you end up. It was absolutely brilliant, even though it took all the money I'd saved up for it - the fare and the hotels and eating in restaurants were to blame for that. At least I know I can cope on my own now and that's a new thing for me. Sadly, I haven't managed to keep up with the people I met in all those different cultures - I'm not surprised though - that's life. I was told to stick to the script whether it was in French, German or Spanish. People don't even ask many questions - it got quite boring after a while, because I felt there wasn't any real communication between me and them. And if it's raining, you get wet just hopping on and off the coach. I didn't have high hopes before I started, although it certainly was a good way of earning some much-needed cash, and there were some nice people at head office, but in the end I did wonder if I couldn't have found something a bit more inspiring. How often do people get a year off in their lifetime?\n",
            "Last year, Tim Fitzgerald exhibited photographs of his family, but in the current exhibition, which he shares with two other visual artists, he focuses solely on landscapes. What's your impression of them? I'm not sure he has what it takes to move beyond his family. Last year's images of his nearest and dearest were very moving, weren't they - there was a wonderful close-up of his sister's face, almost like an abstract. But these landscapes, they're not impressive or particularly articulate. I know he invokes the influence of several famous painters. You didn't find any of that in his landscapes? No. I think he has produced a couple of strong images, but there's no sign of them in the current show and I'm at a loss to know why. It's a very random choice. And also, four small photos in a large gallery feel very sparse. You can see it was an attempt to draw you in, but for me it backfired. You need more impact to raise the curtain on the exhibition - it's not as if it's the last room, it's the first, and you move on to other artists' works,\n",
            "One of my own thoughts about this piece is the idea that you're letting yourself go, abandoning yourself. For me, that's certainly what happens to me. When you're really immersed in it, you're no longer self-conscious, you're absolutely the recipient of the sound. For me it's not even as if it conjures up a specific event. At one point, I was playing it all the time - in supermarket queues, walking into work - having that sound in my ears gave me a world and a space that was very different. My family got pretty fed up. Certainly my husband winces at my corny tastes. I don't know if corny's the right word, but a colleague once said to me she would have expected something less banal. I find that rather sad. OK, so it's a piece that obviously works for many other people too, but that doesn't mean to say it should be denigrated, just because you don't have to have great sophistication in music to appreciate it.\n",
            "I want to talk to you today about a spice which is not very well known outside its home territory, and that is mastic. Mastic is a resinous substance which comes from a tree of the pistachio nut family and it is one of Europe's oldest spices. In fact, in its heyday it was considered so precious that armies quite literally fought over the islands where it was grown so that their masters would have the right to control its cultivation and sale. Let's take a look first at how mastic is produced. The mastic tree itself resembles an olive to the untrained eye but is not quite as large. In a process which is rather similar to the collection of rubber, growers cut the bark of the tree so that the tree then has to exude a sticky sap or resin to heal the wound, and this sap is mastic. The sap needs to harden in order to be of any use and strangely this only happens in the Mediterranean area. Efforts have been made in the past to transplant and cultivate the tree in other parts of the world, but so far without success. The resin is then removed from the tree and, because it's so precious, people even pick up the dirt under the tree and ensure that every last tiny bit of mastic is harvested. The growers try to pick out any grit which might have become embedded in the mastic gum. They just use simple pins to do this; unusually for nowadays, there are no mechanical aids or gadgets to speed up the process. Everything is still done in the traditional, labour-intensive way, by hand. If you examine a small piece of mastic it will look like a white crystal, similar to sea salt. Poets have even mentioned mastic in their work, alluding to it rather romantically as 'silver tears', suggesting again how much it's valued. Having harvested and cleaned the crystals, the growers often take the mastic from their trees, except for a small amount which they keep for their personal use, to a local co-operative, which contacts various commercial buyers and negotiates a decent price for the growers. Now, what is mastic actually used for? In fact, its use can be traced back thousands of years. Archaeologists have found small lumps of mastic with the imprint of juvenile human teeth, suggesting that the earliest use of mastic was as a chewing gum for young people, something which still occurs today. Nowadays it's also used as a flavouring in sweet things like biscuits and to great effect in ice cream. Its value here is that it also provides a stickier texture, which means that it takes longer to soften, a useful quality in the hot Mediterranean summers. Mastic can also be used to flavour liquids. For example, in some rural areas, small fires are lit and a few grains of mastic dropped on the hot charcoal. Then pots are inverted on top so the clay picks up the flavour of the smoke and the mastic. Chilled water is then poured in, and when this is drunk it tastes very subtly of mastic. Apart from its culinary uses, some mastic is also sold for other purposes. It can be used in shampoo, toothpaste and, indeed, for certain stomach ailments. In fact, it's this area that mastic producers are now looking towards to provide a wider use for their produce, now that natural herbs and spices are being investigated to provide the medical products of the future.\n"
